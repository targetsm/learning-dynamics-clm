it &apos;s that pyramid .
in mother &apos;s milk .
it had two-@@ to-@@ three-@@ to-@@ 400 times the toxic loads ever allowed by the ep@@ a .
often what j@@ ams us up is se@@ wage .
what do you do when you have this sort of disrup@@ ted flow ?
stephen pal@@ u@@ mb@@ i : following the mer@@ cur@@ y tra@@ il
i really thought they were so beneath me .
but we didn &apos;t realize at the time that we actually needed a third manipul@@ ator , because we couldn &apos;t manipulate the neck from inside and walk the horse at the same time .
and now we would like to introduce you to jo@@ ey .
b@@ j : and mi@@ key also has , in his fingers , the ability to move the tail from left to right , and up and down with the other hand .
mi@@ key bre@@ tt , cra@@ ig , leo , z@@ em jo@@ aqu@@ in and ba@@ si@@ l and me .
in winter , there &apos;s a lot of sleeping going on ; you enjoy your family life inside .
the thing to watch for as a global philanthropy industry comes about -- and that &apos;s exactly what is happening -- is how the aspi@@ ration is to flip these old assumptions , for philanthropy to become open and big and fast and connected , in service of the long term .
now , all of these big things for love -- experiments -- aren &apos;t going to take off .
i &apos;m going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories , which are innovation , competi@@ tions and social investing .
it may be that the social sin@@ gul@@ arity ahead is the one that we fear the most : a conver@@ gence of catastro@@ ph@@ es , of environmental degra@@ dation , of weapons of mass destruction , of pande@@ mics , of poverty .
i believe that there are new , hidden ten@@ sions that are actually happening between people and institutions -- institutions that are the institutions that people in@@ habit in their daily life : schools , hospitals , work@@ places , factories , offices , etc .
the first gentleman , he &apos;s a ba@@ ker .
so , think of the three sett@@ ings i &apos;ve talked to you about : factory , migration , office .
they were living on top of the work@@ shops where they were working .
so , how many of you have ever gotten behind the wheel of a car when you really shouldn &apos;t have been driving ?
one of the things that we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed several vehicles -- is what we believe is the world &apos;s first autonom@@ ously dri@@ fting car .
now , clearly we &apos;re not going to put a couple of electrodes on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track .
watch the mental work@@ load , and watch the ste@@ ering .
so today , i &apos;m going to tell you about some people who didn &apos;t move out of their neighborhoods .
so a few years ago , l.a. county decided that they needed to spend 2.@@ 5 billion dollars to repair the city schools .
i mean , literally , her hometown is called whit@@ es@@ ville , west virginia .
so these three guys all understand how to produc@@ tively channel dollars through our local economies to meet existing market demands , reduce the social problems that we have now and prevent new problems in the future .
our mun@@ ici@@ p@@ alities , rural and urban , play the oper@@ ational course of infrastructure -- things like waste dis@@ pos@@ al , energy demand , as well as social costs of unemp@@ loyment , dro@@ p-@@ out rates , in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rates and the impacts of various public health costs .
and reading that book made me re@@ exam@@ ine that theory because i need to explain what i mean by that .
and i think because early on , frankly , my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time .
and my question is , how did we get from there to here ?
i went to deaf clubs .
and yet , we have nobody who is trying to ensure that the next generation of children born to afri@@ can@@ -@@ americans and a@@ sians come out with crea@@ my skin and yellow hair .
and he ended up achieving at a level that had never before been con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ated by any member of his family .
the experience of down syndrome people includes those who are actors , those who are writers , some who are able to live fully indepen@@ dently in adul@@ tho@@ od .
and a lot of the time the question of par@@ en@@ tho@@ od is , what do we v@@ ali@@ date in our children , and what do we cure in them ?
and ultimately i feel that in the same way that we test fla@@ me-@@ re@@ tar@@ dant pa@@ jam@@ as in an in@@ fer@@ no to ensure they won &apos;t catch fire when our child reaches across the sto@@ ve , so these stories of families negoti@@ ating these extreme differences reflect on the universal experience of parenting , which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think , where did you come from ?
and he had a very large head , which she thought might indi@@ cate hydro@@ ce@@ ph@@ al@@ us .
and i came from a very privileged background . i was very lucky .
never shown this picture before , and probably going to be su@@ ed for it .
the point being , this is going to be very , very intensive on the programming side .
you want a separate thing , like the ac adap@@ tor .
if you &apos;re in a desert , they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart .
not something you &apos;d en@@ vy or want to do .
and it &apos;s not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000 , though , i invite you to do that , and 10,000 would be even better .
and there are days -- i don &apos;t know about the rest of you guys -- but there are days when i pal@@ p@@ ably feel how much i rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life .
so actually now on this website , we have 18@@ ,000 people .
and we &apos;re building upon innovations of generations who went before us .
but remember , gree@@ ce is there today .
and when you think about the economy through these two different len@@ ses , you understand why this crisis is so hard to solve , because the worse the crisis gets , the higher the sta@@ kes are , the more each side thinks they know the answer and the other side is just going to ru@@ in everything .
that &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , and that presents a more difficult issue .
the phrase that you want , if you &apos;re a graduate student or a post@@ do@@ c or you &apos;re a professor , a 3@@ 8@@ -year-old economics professor , is , &quot; i &apos;m an empi@@ ri@@ ci@@ st .
we know what it &apos;s like to have these people on tv , in congress , yel@@ ling about how the end of the world is coming if we don &apos;t adopt their view completely , because it &apos;s happened about the dollar ever since there &apos;s been a dollar .
and he said to the guy , &quot; why have you put stuff on the back that no one will ever see ? &quot;
i thought , well that &apos;s not good enough .
the wi@@ ring from your sensory appar@@ at@@ us to those bits is shorter than the bits that have to pass through the thin@@ ky bit , the cortex .
where are you feeling this ?
and also tri@@ u@@ mph , this sense of transcen@@ dence , this &quot; i never knew that . ah , this is something new . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to sha@@ me@@ lessly ex@@ pose something to you , which is beautiful to me .
and then i can &apos;t tell you how hard it is to do that radi@@ ator , which is cur@@ ved .
no one &apos;s going to notice those split lines and changes .
but what i have to do now , feeling again , what i &apos;ve got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzy@@ mes , of these trig@@ gers into something early on in the process , that you pick it up , not through your thinking , but through your feeling .
no time . it says i have two minutes left , so we can &apos;t do this .
now i think it &apos;s too easy .
we have se@@ cul@@ ar@@ ized badly , i would argue .
we need data , we don &apos;t need help .
you need to keep repe@@ ating the lesson 10 times a day .
this comes across also in the way in which religions set up rituals around important feelings .
and when they teach us a lesson , they do it via the body .
but that feeling of puzz@@ lement is structural to contemporary art .
the people in the modern world , in the se@@ cular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher sou@@ l-@@ like concerns , tend to be isolated individuals .
if you want to change the world , you have to group together , you have to be collaborative .
and i say , &quot; of course . &quot; and they say , &quot; so aren &apos;t you sort of religious ? &quot;
because you &apos;ve agreed on 90 percent of things , because you have a shared view on so many things , and you polit@@ ely diff@@ er .
so it took me from places like chile -- the at@@ aca@@ ma desert in chile -- to sib@@ eria , to underground mines in the japanese al@@ ps , in northern america , all the way to antarctica and even to the south pole .
you need something like tens of meg@@ at@@ ons of water -- almost a gi@@ g@@ at@@ on of water -- in order to have any chance of catching this neutr@@ ino .
the toilets there are literally holes in the ground covered with a wooden sha@@ ck .
so this is us landing on the ross ice shelf in antarctica .
the fabric alone weigh@@ s two tons .
an@@ il an@@ an@@ th@@ as@@ wa@@ my : what it takes to do extreme astro@@ physics
well , first you have to , as an engineer , scope the problem . how big is it ?
and a book@@ mobile -- the size of a van with a satellite dish , a printer , bin@@ der and cu@@ tter , and kids make their own books .
we have one of these things now . it &apos;s completely cool .
but we sent -- thought , ok , if we &apos;re going to need to do this , let &apos;s do it in-@@ library .
the ge@@ t@@ ty here is moving their books to the uc@@ la , which is where we have one these scanning centers , and scanning their out@@ -of-@@ copyright books , which is fabulous .
it costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a dis@@ k and put it online , if you &apos;re doing things in volume .
we ten@@ ded towards lon@@ ger@@ -@@ term things and also things that people can re@@ use and make into new movies , which has just been great fun .
so anyway , you &apos;ve got basically an idea of where things came from .
so envi@@ sion what it looks like all wrapped up .
it looked more like this when it was all wrapped up -- not quite so pretty .
and frankly , i face a big obstac@@ le .
but these are essentially ex@@ ter@@ n@@ alized stom@@ ach@@ s and lungs .
so , fung@@ i and mycelium sequ@@ est@@ er carbon dioxide in the form of cal@@ ci@@ um ox@@ al@@ ates .
the mycelium , in the right conditions , produces a mushroom -- it bur@@ sts through with such fer@@ o@@ city that it can break as@@ ph@@ al@@ t .
and i &apos;ll show you a graph here .
there &apos;s a ve@@ t@@ ted press release that you can read -- it &apos;s ve@@ t@@ ted by do@@ d -- if you google &quot; sta@@ me@@ ts &quot; and &quot; smallpox . &quot;
so , the house is no longer su@@ itable for inva@@ sion .
too many with@@ dra@@ w@@ als from the carbon bank , and so this population will be shut down .
so we had our own mini@@ ature rainforest , a private beach with a coral reef .
so eight of us went in : four men and four women .
we stopped ir@@ ri@@ gating our soil , as much as we could .
but on the other hand , it was the scientific gold of the project , because we could really cr@@ ank this baby up , as a scientific tool , and see if we could , in fact , find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone .
i had been growing all my own food .
and all of it was coming from this : shrimp farms .
it &apos;s such a huge subject . &quot;
and if you lose where you are in your biosphere , or are perhaps having a difficulty connecting with where you are in the biosphere , i would say to you , take a deep breath .
the cause of our trou@@ bles is actually the complexity that science has given us .
we have now found treatments for nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions that a human being can have .
there &apos;s another sign that we need pit cre@@ ws , and that &apos;s the un@@ mana@@ ge@@ able cost of our care .
skill number one is the ability to recognize success and the ability to recognize failure .
we got the lead safety engineer for bo@@ eing to help us .
there &apos;s a deep resistance because using these tools forces us to confront that we &apos;re not a system , forces us to behave with a different set of values .
and most of those lo@@ sses are because of things we know .
if you don &apos;t just want a queen , you can buy , actually , a three-@@ pound package of bees , which comes in the mail , and of course , the pos@@ tal office is always very concerned when they get , you know , your three-@@ pound pack@@ ages of bees .
but if you &apos;re losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your colonies , you can &apos;t survive three years in a row . and we &apos;re really worried about losing this segment of our industry .
and bees are very fai@@ th@@ ful .
and of course , bees are not the only important factor here .
but i also want to rein@@ force some of the ideas we &apos;ve heard here , because having a mea@@ dow or living by a mea@@ dow is transforma@@ tional .
well actually , i &apos;ve &#91; been &#93; whist@@ ling since the age of four , about four .
i lost my face .
and i want to first re@@ hear@@ se with you your whist@@ ling .
some of them are very easy .
and they also are able to show and to exhi@@ bit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence .
look at this young bean that is moving to catch the light every time .
how is it possible to do this without a brain ?
and why are they so similar ?
thank you .
they &apos;re going to be entering this car one by one .
and also in 50 other cities around the world , people particip@@ ated .
and because it was in union square park , right by a subway station , there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing .
they &apos;re wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt .
he gave 2,000 high fi@@ ves that day , and he wa@@ shed his hands before and after@@ ward and did not get sick .
and not knowing where help was needed always en@@ su@@ red that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most .
our goal over the next year is to get water can@@ ary ready for the field and to open-source the hardware so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evalu@@ ation , so we can tackle this problem together .
now why am i talking about cows ?
so what i &apos;m propos@@ ing is , just as we require reading , writing , arith@@ metic , american history , so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world -- about their history , about their cre@@ eds , about their texts , their music , their symbo@@ li@@ sms , their pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions , their requi@@ rements .
all i &apos;m saying is -- facts . facts only .
except , of course , it wasn &apos;t the sheep &apos;s cle@@ ver@@ ness .
the lesson we learn from this is you don &apos;t have to have a mind to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary .
and how can we do that ?
i &apos;m talking also about christi@@ an@@ ity .
yes .
but i wish it were better .
and here i think , &quot; wait a minute . &quot;
well , this from &quot; the purpose driven life &quot; -- &quot; the bible must become the author@@ it@@ ative standard for my life , the compas@@ s i rely on for direction , the coun@@ sel i listen to for making wise decisions and the ben@@ ch@@ mark i use for evalu@@ ating everything . &quot;
now do we really want to commit ourselves to eng@@ ul@@ fing all the other religions when their holy books are telling them , &quot; don &apos;t listen to the other side , that &apos;s just sat@@ an talking ! &quot;
ears are made not for hearing , but for listening .
it looks a bit like this .
if you can &apos;t hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice , it &apos;s too loud .
first of all , listen consciously .
and my relationship to especially human-@@ made objects which someone else said they work like this , well , i can say they work a different way , a little bit .
so kids don &apos;t have as hard of a time with this , and i saw in my own son , i gave him this book .
and then you can take the little piano circuit off the pencil .
and so we &apos;re like , &quot; we gotta put a video out about this . &quot;
okay , just wait for this one . this is good .
it &apos;s really going to be seven billion pairs of hands , each following their own pas@@ sions , and each kind of like a mo@@ sa@@ ic coming up and creating this world in their back@@ yards and in their kit@@ ch@@ ens .
but they won &apos;t come to us directly through light .
but einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical o@@ dd@@ ity .
it would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn &apos;t , anymore than light can escape .
this is from my group -- a slightly less glamorous computer mode@@ ling .
and surely , somewhere in the universe two black holes have mer@@ ged .
galaxies form , and generations of stars form in those galaxies , and around one star , at least one star , is a habit@@ able planet .
so we have to wonder , if there is a multi@@ verse , in some other pat@@ ch of that multi@@ verse , are there creatures ?
of the 100 in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated people that are released , 60 will return to prison .
well , it has its pl@@ uses and min@@ uses .
from the fact that they are only serving one audience , mainly the western culture .
i go everywhere to make believe it &apos;s iran .
now comes the green movement -- the summer of 2009 , as my film is released -- the u@@ pri@@ sing begins in the streets of te@@ h@@ ran .
it can &apos;t afford to doubt the person who tends the child .

i will come to it later .
you cannot command compassion unless you become lim@@ it@@ less , and nobody can become lim@@ it@@ less , either you are or you are not . period .
you act compas@@ sion@@ ately .
if this does not blow your mind , then you have no emotion .
and let &apos;s pause here .
it &apos;s good for motivated students .
in a traditional classroom , you have a couple of homework , homework , lecture , homework , lecture , and then you have a sna@@ p@@ shot ex@@ am .
and you can go to the site right now . it &apos;s all free . not trying to sell anything .
red means they &apos;re stuck .
and we &apos;re seeing it over and over and over again .
i &apos;m still doing all the videos , but we have a ro@@ ck@@ star team doing the software .
and they &apos;re literally saying , &quot; hey , this is nice , but ... &quot; like that focus graph , a lot of the teachers said , &quot; i have a feeling that a lot of the kids are ju@@ mping around and not focusing on one topic . &quot;
but there are also hallucinations as well , and hallucinations are completely different .
i see a lot of children . they are walking up and down stairs .
i said , &quot; there is a special form of visual halluc@@ ination which may go with deter@@ i@@ or@@ ating vision or blindness .
the first thing he said was he saw a hand@@ ker@@ chief in mi@@ da@@ ir .
and he turned around . and then he divided into six figures in stri@@ ped shir@@ ts , who started walking towards her .
but no more than one percent of the people ac@@ knowledge them , because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something .
when people have these simple geome@@ trical hallucinations , the primary visual cortex is activated .
it is only if one is visually impa@@ ired or blind that the process is interrup@@ ted .
and actually i &apos;m a little visually impa@@ ired myself .
but i would come back from those di@@ ves and try to share the experience with words , and they were totally in@@ adequ@@ ate to the task .
it &apos;s unbelievable .
this looks like something out of a dr. se@@ uss book -- just all manner of creatures all over this thing .
and we view it with a camera system i developed called ey@@ e-@@ in-@@ the-@@ sea that uses far red light that &apos;s invisible to most animals , so it &apos;s u@@ no@@ b@@ tru@@ sive .
and it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electronic jellyfish .
ed@@ ith wi@@ dder : the weird , wonderful world of biolumines@@ cence
the yel@@ low-@@ green area is the flu@@ ids of blood , which is mostly water , but it &apos;s also anti@@ bodies , sug@@ ars , hor@@ mones , that kind of thing .
it &apos;s an accurate representation , and it &apos;s pretty much at the correct speed for what is occurring inside you .
one set of dna goes to one side , the other side gets the other set of dna -- identical copies of dna .
it &apos;s able to feel when the cell is ready , when the chromosome is correctly posi@@ tioned .
humanity is now fully into the techno@@ -@@ scientific age .
during 4@@ 1 years of teaching biology at harvard , i watched sadly as bright students turned away from the possibility of a scientific career or even from taking non-@@ required courses in science because they were afraid of failure .
judge opportunity by how few other students and researchers are on hand .
or larger , what &apos;s the role of dark matter in the expansion of the universe ?
humans have lived for much , much longer than the approximately 10,000 years of sett@@ led agricultural civilization in small family groups . nom@@ adi@@ c hun@@ ters bring down rab@@ bits , gathering food .
more recently , that power is un@@ te@@ ther@@ ing and le@@ ap@@ ing off the desk@@ tops , and very , very quickly , we &apos;re going to see a significant proportion , if not the majority of the human race , walking around holding , carrying or wearing super@@ computers linked at spee@@ ds greater than what we consider to be broad@@ band today .
he used the example of a common gra@@ zing area in which each person by simply ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing their own flo@@ ck led to over@@ gra@@ zing and the de@@ ple@@ tion of the resource .
to@@ yo@@ ta , instead of treating its supp@@ li@@ ers as a marketplace , tre@@ ats them as a network and trains them to produce better , even though they are also training them to produce better for their competi@@ tors .
what forms of suffering could be alle@@ vi@@ ated , what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about cooperation ?
now , i &apos;ll show you a fun app that -- we &apos;ve been working on a collaboration with our friends at fli@@ ck@@ r .
yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .

what happened ?
i said , &quot; how many of you now go home earlier than you used to ? &quot;
so you take a piece , you just put it on the side .
the next part i want to show you is something about the positive motivation .
you had to measure the milk and add it , mixing it .
at the top of the sheet , we had little diag@@ ra@@ ms of how do you fold origami .

one day a man told me , &quot; my future does not look brilliant , but i want to have a brilliant future for my son . &quot;
so the key here is empathy .
we revi@@ sed the mental health component of the primary health care services by adding psycho@@ -@@ social care and psycho@@ -@@ social coun@@ sel@@ ors to the system .
when jun@@ gi@@ an analy@@ st in@@ ge mi@@ ss@@ ma@@ h@@ l visited afghanistan , she saw the inner w@@ ounds of war -- wide@@ spread despair , trau@@ ma and depression . and yet , in this county of 30 million people , there were only two dozen psychiat@@ rists . mi@@ ss@@ ma@@ h@@ l talks about her work helping to build the country &apos;s system of psycho@@ social coun@@ sel@@ ing , promot@@ ing both individual and , perhaps , national healing .
that &apos;s true of european bio@@ fuels .
top left , we have canada and australia , with enormous land areas , very high per capita consumption , 200 or 300 light bulbs per person , and very low population den@@ sities .
wind power produces a bit more , 2.@@ 5 watts per square meter , but that &apos;s only twice as big as 1.@@ 25 watts per square meter , so that means if you wanted literally to produce total energy consumption in all forms on average from wind farms , you need wind farms half the area of the u.k .
but the same goes for renewables as well .
next , there &apos;s the heating le@@ ver .
so , if you wanted to get 16 light bulbs , remember , today our total energy consumption is 1@@ 25 light bulbs &apos; worth .
he mentioned four great world orchestr@@ as , and the fifth one was vene@@ zu@@ ela &apos;s youth symphony orchestra .

from the minute a child &apos;s taught how to play an instrument , he &apos;s no longer poor .
think about it , all right ? i &apos;m going to answer the phone three different times .
behavioral mar@@ kers matter .
that actually occurred this year . she took early retirement .
we are obsessed with this way of thinking .
classic . hip frac@@ ture often leads to institu@@ tion@@ alization of a senior .
these discoveries of behavioral mar@@ kers , and behavioral changes are game changing , and like the discovery of the microscope because of our collecting data streams that we &apos;ve actually never done before .
it &apos;s achiev@@ able . we should do it economically , we should do it mor@@ ally , and we should do it for quality of life .
we will see 30,000 new infected websites .
this is the market leader in mal@@ ware distribution , the black hole exploit pack , responsible for nearly one third of mal@@ ware distribution in the last couple of quarters .
so this is writing out the mal@@ icious code , and a few seconds later , on the left-hand side , you &apos;ll see the att@@ ac@@ ker &apos;s screen get some interesting new text .
what &apos;s really insul@@ ting about this is not only does it provide the att@@ ac@@ kers with access to your data , but when the scan fin@@ i@@ shes , they tell you in order to clean up the fake viruses , you have to regi@@ ster the product .
a little more searching , and here &apos;s our cyber@@ criminal .
okay ? so you can see a list of wireless networks .
you see , technology &apos;s changing at a st@@ agger@@ ing rate , and that 2@@ 50,000 pieces of mal@@ ware won &apos;t stay the same for long .
i wasn &apos;t very good at reading things .
you all know the story , right .
and that was really cool .
it was extraordinary .
&quot; you can call it a dinosaur , but look at the velo@@ ci@@ ra@@ p@@ tor : the velo@@ ci@@ ra@@ p@@ tor is cool . &quot;
and they obviously make a lot of money off of them .
and so he agreed .
and quite frankly , i think if colon@@ el sand@@ ers was to be careful how he wor@@ ded it , he could actually adverti@@ se an extra piece .
that &apos;s based on diet in@@ take surve@@ ys , it &apos;s based on levels of obesity , it &apos;s based on a range of factors that gives you an approxim@@ ate guess as to how much food is actually going into people &apos;s mou@@ ths .
that &apos;s what &apos;s in fields around the world every single year .
go one step up , and you get to farmers , who throw away sometimes a third or even more of their harvest because of cos@@ metic standards .
the one in the middle , on my kitchen table . not much difference .
western countries throw out nearly half of their food , not because it &apos;s ine@@ di@@ ble -- but because it doesn &apos;t look appe@@ aling . tri@@ stra@@ m stu@@ art del@@ ves into the shocking data of wa@@ sted food , calling for a more responsible use of global resources .
and this is all done , by the way , by the international astronom@@ ical union .
now , we &apos;re going to be going to mars one day . and when we do , it &apos;s going to be unfair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridiculous names .
&quot; listen , i &apos;m going back to the sw@@ amp mer@@ ma@@ id . can you call me in a little while ? &quot;
we have names for places where people don &apos;t exist .
blue cheese , ran@@ ch , oil and v@@ ine@@ g@@ ar , thousand islands and house .
now this is isa@@ ac from a vietna@@ me@@ se st@@ amp .

it just seems like it &apos;s not sexy and elegant , it &apos;s hidden .
thank you .
it was incredibly successful .
it thought of itself as being dis@@ connected from the internet , but it was possible for somebody to s@@ mu@@ ggle a us@@ b drive in there , or something like that , and software got in there that causes the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges , in that case , to actually destroy themselves .
and so if you hear an expert talking about the internet and saying it can do this , or it does do this , or it will do that , you should treat it with the same skep@@ tici@@ sm that you might treat the comm@@ ents of an economist about the economy or a wea@@ ther@@ man about the weather , or something like that .
good afternoon .
so military technologies can influence the course of the world , can make or break world peace -- and there lies the issue with cy@@ ber weapons .

multiply 22 times 47 , make sure you get 1,@@ 0@@ 3@@ 4 , or the calcul@@ ators are not working . do all of you get 1,@@ 0@@ 3@@ 4 ? 1,@@ 0@@ 3@@ 4 ?
5@@ 29 .
7@@ 22 is 500 -- ooh , that &apos;s a harder one .
in the meanwhile , let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little tri@@ c@@ ki@@ er .
ok , any six of them .
audience : february .
what year , chris , would you like ?
audience : six . six .
now , 5@@ 7 times 6@@ 8 is 3@@ ,@@ 400 , plus 4@@ 7@@ 6 is 3@@ 8@@ 7@@ 6 , that &apos;s 3@@ 8@@ ,@@ 7@@ 60 plus 17@@ 1 , 3@@ 8@@ ,@@ 7@@ 60 plus 17@@ 1 is 3@@ 8@@ ,@@ 9@@ 31 .
a third time , it &apos;s just being a techn@@ ician .
change is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .
had collected photographs of me , as mothers will do .
and i &apos;ll just say what i &apos;m about to do . what i &apos;m about to do -- i hope you can recognize that there &apos;s a distor@@ ted s@@ ine wave , almost a tri@@ an@@ gu@@ lar wave upon this he@@ w@@ let@@ t-@@ pack@@ ard o@@ sc@@ il@@ lo@@ scope .
but you will need to know eigh@@ th-@@ grade al@@ ge@@ bra , and we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
now , so i know the frequency .
i &apos;m going home for a mid@@ term . a ri@@ ot &apos;s going on on campus .
i pop up the top , and there &apos;s a cu@@ pol@@ a .
well i &apos;m here to suggest there &apos;s a better way , that less might actually equal more .
secondly , our new man@@ tra : small is sexy .
maybe , just maybe , less might equal more .
that fixed behavior -- which is ri@@ gi@@ d and stereoty@@ ped and ends up with a meal -- changes .
if we &apos;ve got them wired up with an electro@@ en@@ ce@@ ph@@ alo@@ gram , the right brain of each of them becomes at@@ tuned , so that the joy@@ ful emergence of this earliest of play scenes and the physi@@ ology of that is something we &apos;re beginning to get a handle on .
this happens to be ok -- he &apos;s an an@@ atom@@ ically interested little boy and that &apos;s his mom . other situations wouldn &apos;t be quite so good .
they &apos;d given me a large grant when i was an acade@@ mic@@ ian for the study of fel@@ ony dr@@ un@@ ken drivers , and i thought i had a pretty good track record , and by the time i had spent half an hour talking about play , it was obvious that they were not -- did not feel that play was serious .
and i think if you think about life without play -- no humor , no fli@@ r@@ tation , no movies , no games , no fantasy and , and , and .
found that when he looked at a play@@ ground out of a window into which he had been con@@ fined , he felt something different .
character@@ ized by a feeling of ener@@ gi@@ zed focus , full invol@@ vement and success in the process of the activity .
and its hu@@ gely important in learning and cra@@ fting the brain .
we decided to do something a little bit different and transform fla@@ vors that were very familiar -- so in this case , so we take a car@@ rot cake , put it in a bl@@ en@@ der , and we have kind of like a car@@ rot cake juice , and then that went into a balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to create this hol@@ low shell of car@@ rot cake ice cre@@ am , i guess , and it comes off looking like , you know , ju@@ pit@@ er &apos;s floating around your plate .
h@@ c : so , after about a day of chris and i staring at each other , we came up with something that was pretty close to the ham@@ burger pat@@ ty , and as you can see it basically forms like ham@@ burger meat .
h@@ c : so this is where we step into the future and we le@@ ap@@ frog ahead .
so , why don &apos;t we hear more about the world ?
where &apos;s art ? i got productivity . i got sports .
and one of them is called ta@@ ke@@ ta . which is which ?
the full videos are online if you are interested .
but if i come up really close and st@@ are directly at the camera on this laptop then you &apos;ll see these nice cri@@ sp eyes .
i &apos;d like to show you thing called s@@ n@@ out , which is -- the idea behind this project is to make a robot that appears as if it &apos;s continu@@ ally surprised to see you .
if this virus was in thousands of individuals at this point , why was it the case that it took us until 198@@ 4 to be able to discover this virus ?
deep in a remote region of camer@@ o@@ on , two hun@@ ters stal@@ k their prey .
they &apos;re also going to ask you the question that when we knew that this was the way that hiv entered into the human population , and that other diseases had the potential to enter like this , why did we let these behaviors continue ?
paul worked for years on the camer@@ o@@ on@@ ian national radio and television , and he spoke about health issues . he was a health correspon@@ dent .
and let &apos;s face it , any new retro@@ virus in the human population -- it &apos;s something we should be aware of .
and because of that announ@@ cement , we got a big article in the new york times , which led to more press , which led to more attention , and me deci@@ ding to become ceo of that company -- whereas i was just an advi@@ ser -- and raising a round of venture capital and ra@@ mping up hi@@ ring .
and they &apos;re twe@@ eting , in some cases , from behind close@@ d-@@ door se@@ ssions with the president .
people have raised tens of thousands of dollars over twitter in a matter of days on several occa@@ sions .
my mother says that i started reading at the age of two , although i think four is probably close to the truth .
my mother was an admini@@ str@@ ator .
i must say that before i went to the u.s. i didn &apos;t consciously identify as african .
the political climate in the u.s. at the time was ten@@ se , and there were deb@@ ates going on about im@@ migration .
when i learned , some years ago , that writers were expected to have had really unhappy child@@ hoods to be successful , i began to think about how i could invent horrible things my parents had done to me .
now , the conventional wisdom was that nig@@ eri@@ ans don &apos;t read literature .
she introduced them to a book about the southern life that they had left behind : &quot; they sat around , reading the book themselves , listening to me read the book , and a kind of para@@ dise was re@@ gained . &quot;
it literally flat@@ -@@ lined .
well for the sake of time , i want to focus on just three strategies .
we need to fundamentally re@@ define who it is that experts are .
i &apos;m looking for a third way : i &apos;m preparing to get alzheimer &apos;s disease .
would they give me char@@ ts and graphs that i could color ?
al@@ an@@ na sha@@ i@@ k@@ h : how i &apos;m preparing to get alzheimer &apos;s
the network has two components in them .
the battery is not the gas tank , in a sense .
and these prices are actually with clean electrons .
and i had to quit and come and do this thing called a better place .
as we star@@ ed scaling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the u.s. ?
we go back down . it &apos;s going to go up and down .
now where is the car industry on that ?
now when we &apos;re looking at solving big problems , we need to start thinking in two numbers .
we have to make the right moral decision .
they see us as ro@@ cking the boat , and you can understand why .
complexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve , and you can &apos;t solve it by pos@@ tu@@ l@@ ating an agent that is even more complex , there@@ by simply com@@ poun@@ ding the problem .
now , there &apos;s a typical scientific journal , the quar@@ ter@@ ly review of biology .
and however we define athe@@ ism , it &apos;s surely the kind of academic belief that a person is enti@@ tled to hold without being vi@@ li@@ fied as an un@@ patri@@ otic , une@@ lec@@ table non-@@ citizen .
in 1998 , lar@@ son and with@@ am pol@@ led the cre@@ am of american scientists , those who &apos;d been honored by election to the national academy of sciences , and among this se@@ lect group , belief in a personal god dropped to a sha@@ tter@@ ing seven percent .
darwin said , &quot; i have never been an athe@@ ist in the same sense of den@@ ying the existence of a god .
nonetheless , if we want to attract deep down athe@@ ists to come out public@@ ly , we &apos;re going to have find something better to stick on our ban@@ ner than &quot; to@@ oth fair@@ y &quot; or &quot; te@@ apo@@ t ag@@ no@@ stic . &quot;
we need an anti-@@ temp@@ le@@ ton to step forward .
what this picture suggests to us is that we &apos;ve got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capit@@ alized . not that it &apos;s become less capital intensive -- that there &apos;s less money that &apos;s required -- but that the ownership of this capital , the way the capit@@ alization happens , is radically distributed . each of us , in these advanced economies , has one of these , or something rather like it -- a computer .
the critical innovation here is instead of our engineers , or our people saying which is the most relevant , we &apos;re going to go out and count what you , people out there on the web , for whatever reason -- van@@ ity , pleasure -- produced links , and tied to each other . we &apos;re going to count those , and count them up .
and if dinner isn &apos;t entirely obvious , think of sex .
but -- and this is the dark lin@@ ing -- it is threatened by -- in the same way that it threat@@ ens -- the incu@@ mb@@ ent industrial systems .
due to some sli@@ p-@@ ups , he managed to escape dressed as a woman and ran from london back to nigeria where , according to our constitu@@ tion , those in office as govern@@ ors , president -- as in many countries -- have im@@ m@@ unity and cannot be pro@@ secu@@ ted . but what happened : people were so ou@@ tra@@ ged by this behavior that it was possible for his state legis@@ l@@ ature to im@@ pe@@ ach him and get him out of office .
we are grateful , but we know that we can take charge of our own dest@@ in@@ ies if we have the will to reform .
and in the three years that i was finance minister , they made an average of 3@@ 60 million dollars profit per year .
and what is more important , because we want to get away from oil and diver@@ si@@ fy -- and there are so many opportunities in this one big country , as in many countries in africa -- what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone , but from non-@@ oil .
not all of them have been perfect , or will be , but the trend is very clear .
so , she &apos;ll make a little pair of dun@@ g@@ are@@ es with cor@@ du@@ ro@@ ys , with african material mixed in . very creative designs , has reached a stage where she even had an order from wal@@ -@@ mart .
every year , 3@@ 6,000 people in the united states die of seas@@ onal flu .
this worked well for most patho@@ gens , somewhat well for cra@@ f@@ ty bugs like flu , but not at all for hiv , for which humans have no natural im@@ m@@ unity .
and also , what the anti@@ bodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutr@@ alize the virus .
many thought that it was just impossible to make an aids vaccine , but today , evidence tells us otherwise .
in the longer term , what they can do is use these tools of retro@@ -@@ vaccin@@ ology to make a preven@@ tive flu vaccine .
luckily for us , we live in an era of brea@@ th@@ taking bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal advances .
india , mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines , and they may be the first place we see these vaccines in use .
s@@ b : you know , everybody says it &apos;s 10 years , but it &apos;s been 10 years every 10 years .
and these are not really a people op@@ pressed by poverty .
i would also like to pay hom@@ age and honor to the ted fel@@ lows june ar@@ un@@ ga , james shi@@ k@@ wat@@ i , andrew , and the other ted fel@@ lows .
did you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in africa is not invested here in africa ?
i belong to an internet discussion for@@ um , an african internet discussion for@@ um , and i asked them , i said , &quot; since 1960 , we &apos;ve had exactly 20@@ 4 african heads of state , since 1960 . &quot;
that &apos;s not wealth creation . it &apos;s wealth re@@ distribution .
if you look into their traditional systems , africans organize their states in two types .
and when they produce their crops , they sell the sur@@ plus on market@@ places .
a bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed .
and i was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society .
scott &apos;s results were full of them .
and the challenge with these kinds of algorith@@ mic fil@@ ters , these personalized fil@@ ters , is that , because they &apos;re mainly looking at what you click on first , it can throw off that balance .
we need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspe@@ ctives .
she said &quot; yes , that &apos;s former vice president al gore and his wife ti@@ pper . &quot;
just in the last two days , we got the new temperature records in january .
a lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy .
help with the mass persu@@ a@@ sion campaign that will start this spring .
and all the burning of oil and coal and gas , all the fossil fuels , have changed the atmosphere great@@ ly .
you go in along the shore , you can find it everywhere .
so this is the gulf of mexico , spar@@ k@@ ling place full of fish .
but he told ted that on the last day he went out , a bot@@ t@@ len@@ ose dolphin suddenly appeared next to the boat , and it was s@@ plat@@ tering oil out its blo@@ whole .
we &apos;re starting with something that &apos;s had a lot of stre@@ sses and a lot of problems to begin with .
here are shrimp boats emp@@ loyed .
it turns out that -- you see this sign on almost every commercial vessel in the united states -- you know , if you sp@@ illed a couple of gall@@ ons of oil , you would be in big trouble .
there &apos;s certainly a common theme about nee@@ ding to make the moment out of this .
well i built a fusion reactor when i was 14 years old .
ta@@ yl@@ or wilson : y@@ up , i built a nuclear fusion reactor
everybody : i am my connect@@ ome .
you can recognize them instantly by their fantastic shapes .
we color every neuron in , in a different color , and then we look through all of the images , find the synap@@ ses and note the colors of the two neurons involved in each synap@@ se .
but may i ?
and there &apos;s a lot of evidence that neural activity is en@@ coding our thoughts , feelings and per@@ ceptions , our mental experiences .
let us attempt to read out memories from connect@@ om@@ es .
if you believe that i am my connect@@ ome , i think you must also accept the idea that death is the destruction of your connect@@ ome .
z@@ ach ka@@ plan : ke@@ ith and i lead a research team .
because the way that he presented the concept -- his approach was totally different than ours . he sold it to you as if it was for sale right now .
now , i &apos;m not going to get into the physics of it , but all you need to know is that the faster the mag@@ net &apos;s falling , the greater the stopping force .
z@@ k : i &apos;d just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by target .
while he was doing this , he noticed an unexpected thing .
pack@@ aging that changes color when your milk &apos;s gone off .
z@@ ach ka@@ plan + ke@@ ith sc@@ ha@@ ch@@ t : toys and materials from the future
can we produce a men@@ u that &apos;s delicious without foie gras ?
&quot; spanish chef ac@@ c@@ used ... &quot; -- and the french ac@@ c@@ used him .
he &apos;s really just in love with -- he &apos;s at one with -- he &apos;s the go@@ ose whis@@ per@@ er .
even though they were im@@ prison@@ ed in this garden of ed@@ en with fi@@ gs and everything else .
his biggest obstac@@ le , really , was the marketplace , which demands these days bright yellow foie gras .
and he grab@@ s my arm and the transl@@ ator &apos;s , and duc@@ ks us under a bush and says , &quot; watch this . &quot;
they don &apos;t need anything more . &quot;
but i can taste things .
i really was moved .
he ta@@ sted it and fell in love with it .
if human beings disappeared , life on earth as we know it would flouri@@ sh . &quot;
but now we need a new fire that makes us safe , secure , healthy and dur@@ able .
let me say that again .
america could lead this next automo@@ tive revolution .
we can use some smart it to en@@ h@@ ance trans@@ it and enable car sharing and ride sharing .
most of it now is wa@@ sted and the technologies for saving it keep improving faster than we &apos;re inst@@ all@@ ing them .
well , from the coal burned at the power plant through all these com@@ poun@@ ding lo@@ sses , only a ten@@ th of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pipe as flow .
and when a big plant goes down , you lose a thousand mega@@ watts in milli@@ seconds , often for weeks or months , often without warning .
in 197@@ 6 , for example , government and industry insi@@ sted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of gdp could never go down .
thank you .
and third , the engagement in developing countries was with a narrow set of government el@@ ites with little interaction with the citizens , who are the ultimate benef@@ ici@@ aries of development assi@@ stance .
in this map from mol@@ do@@ va , the green color shows those distri@@ cts that have low spending on schools but good educational outcomes , and the red color shows the opposite .
we will find that these children , too , have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty .
if we take the to@@ oth@@ brush -- i don &apos;t think about the to@@ oth@@ brush .
after , we become a fish ; after , we become a frog ; after , we become a monkey ; after , we become what we are today : a super-@@ monkey , and the fun is , the super-@@ monkey we are today , is at half of the story .
if you walk like that , it &apos;s ok , it &apos;s ok , you can walk , but perhaps , because you walk with the eyes like that , you will not see , oh , there is a hole .
if you look like that , you look to the past , or you look inside if you are very flexible , inside yourself .
that &apos;s why we must adapt .
we can say to our children , ok , done , that was our story . that passed .
no s@@ lou@@ ching , no pants hanging down , none of that stuff .
and the drill ser@@ ge@@ ant starts scre@@ aming at them , and telling them to do all kinds of awful things .
no , no , it begins the first time a child in a mother &apos;s arms looks up at the mother and says , &quot; oh , this must be my mother .
the last chapter in my book is called &quot; the gift of a good start . &quot;
give him to the army . we &apos;ll never see him again . we &apos;ll never see him again . &quot;
you get a job and get out of the house .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s okay . &quot;
i &apos;m a marke@@ ter , and as a marke@@ ter , i know that i &apos;ve never really been in control .
h@@ ul@@ u and net@@ fli@@ x , among other companies , have open va@@ cation policies .
the days are past when a person , company or brand could ti@@ ghtly control their reputation -- online cha@@ tter and spin mean that if you &apos;re relevant , there &apos;s a constant , fre@@ e-@@ form conversation happening about you that you have no control over . tim le@@ ber@@ ech@@ t offers three big ideas about accep@@ ting that loss of control , even designing for it -- and using it as an im@@ pe@@ tus to recomm@@ it to your values .
they want to make people live in fear .
but people did not relate to this .
they were actually att@@ acking them .
seriously , with the amount of change i had noticed in this square , i thought it was 12 years .
i feel that i have dignity that i have lost for so many years . &quot;
so we &apos;ve been studying the babies using a technique that we &apos;re using all over the world and the sounds of all languages .
so babies absor@@ b the statistics of the language and it changes their brains ; it changes them from the citizens of the world to the cul@@ tu@@ re-@@ bound list@@ en@@ ers that we are .
whatever you put in front of them , they &apos;ll take statistics on .
in investi@@ gating the child &apos;s brain , we &apos;re going to un@@ cover deep truths about what it means to be human , and in the process , we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning for our entire lives .
but i have to tell you a funny story .
so what happened now is , when the water@@ color was flowing into the structure , the water@@ colors do not mix with the fer@@ ro@@ fluid .
i could do it again to show it one more time , but some would argue that this is a complete waste of the whis@@ key , and that i should rather drink it .
in that hosp@@ ice , there were 31 men and women who were actively dying .
and my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a sla@@ ve to take care of me .
and you know , we have a society , a world , that is paralyzed by fear .
but it also takes a soft front -- the capacity to really be open to the world as it is , to have an un@@ def@@ ended heart .
may we ac@@ tu@@ alize that capacity for women everywhere .
now , it &apos;s no surprise that when you add con@@ secu@@ tive fi@@ bon@@ ac@@ ci numbers , you get the next fi@@ bon@@ ac@@ ci number . right ?
beneath that , i &apos;ll put a two-@@ by-@@ two square , and next to that , a three-@@ by-@@ three square , beneath that , a five-@@ by-@@ five square , and then an eight-@@ by-@@ eight square , creating one giant re@@ ct@@ angle , right ?
now , being irani@@ an-@@ american presents its own set of problems , as you know .
and i started fre@@ a@@ king out , because i don &apos;t know what kind of cra@@ p my grandfather was into .
but what was interesting was , the paki@@ stan@@ i muslim guy -- see he gives a bad name to muslims and middle ea@@ ster@@ ners and paki@@ stan@@ is from all over the world .
he goes , &quot; i &apos;m going to the zar@@ a store . it &apos;s three miles away .
i go , &quot; he &apos;s got to be my driver . &quot;
mar@@ co tem@@ pest : when asked about deception , he said this : magic is the only honest profession .
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to show you how terrorism actually inter@@ acts with our daily life .
at the same time , while i was intervie@@ wing the red bri@@ g@@ ades , i also discovered that their life was not rul@@ ed by politics or ide@@ ology , but actually was rul@@ ed by economics .
so , i decided that i wanted to investi@@ gate the economics of terrorism .
but the great change came , of course , with globalization and der@@ e@@ gu@@ lation .
now , when i went to look at the figures of the u.s. money supply , the u.s. money supply is the amount of dollars that the federal reserve prints every year in order to satis@@ fy which , of course , reflec@@ ts the growth of the economy .
now , the e@@ ur@@ o was a new@@ ly born currency of great opportunity for business , and , of course , for investment .
this has given me a very special relationship with the ocean .
i wanted to live a life that i could be proud of .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever felt so happy in my entire life .
i don &apos;t see anybody for the whole time that i &apos;m at sea , generally .
awful , really awful .
when they opened this one up , they found its stomach was full of plastic .
i even met one of them and she was just about my size .
and it &apos;s very difficult to be happy on a planet that &apos;s rac@@ ked with famine and d@@ rought .
so anyway , today we &apos;ll talk about architecture a little bit , within the subject of creation and optimism .
it &apos;s too late . that is gone .
can i have the lights off for a moment ?
and so what the buil@@ der will get is every single individual part that has been cu@@ sto@@ m manufac@@ tured off-@@ site and delivered on a truck to the site , to that buil@@ der , and a set of these in@@ struction manu@@ als .
they were asked to design , replace that bridge in six weeks , building it , including all of the parts , manufac@@ tured .
ro@@ sa mexic@@ ano restaurant , where he transpor@@ ts us to the sho@@ res of aca@@ pul@@ co , up on the upper west side , with this wall of cliff diver@@ s who -- there you go , like that .
take it from me . under the bed is not a good hiding spot .
see , they asked me what i wanted to be , then told me what not to be .
standing up for yourself doesn &apos;t have to mean embracing violence .
so we grew up believing no one would ever fall in love with us , that we &apos;d be lonely forever , that we &apos;d never meet someone to make us feel like the sun was something they built for us in their to@@ ol@@ shed .
we were fre@@ aks -- lo@@ b@@ ster cla@@ w boys and be@@ ar@@ ded ladies , od@@ di@@ ties ju@@ ggling depression and lon@@ el@@ iness , playing sol@@ it@@ ai@@ re , spin the bottle , trying to ki@@ ss the w@@ ounded parts of ourselves and he@@ al , but at night , while the others sle@@ pt , we kept walking the ti@@ gh@@ tro@@ pe .
the future states that there is no time other than the collap@@ sation of that sensation of the mirror of the memories in which we are living .
so , as i say before the last piece , feel not as though it is a sphere we live on , rather an infinite plane which has the illusion of leading yourself back to the point of origin .
in on@@ t@@ ari@@ o , the bo@@ real mar@@ ches down south to the north shore of lake super@@ ior .
now , you can apply that same kind of thinking here as well .
and the tail@@ ings pon@@ ds range in size up to 9@@ ,000 ac@@ res .
this is one of the reasons why canada , originally a climate change hero -- we were one of the first sig@@ nat@@ ories of the k@@ yo@@ to accor@@ d .

he creates these op@@ ul@@ ent tab@@ lea@@ us inspired by hier@@ ony@@ m@@ us bos@@ ch , but also by the ka@@ sh@@ mir@@ i tex@@ tiles of his youth .
i &apos;m an eco@@ logist , and i study complexity . i love complexity .
and so now we can look one degrees , two degrees , three degrees away from that no@@ de and eliminate three-@@ quarters of the diagram outside that sphere of influence .
for example , in my first tedtalk , i did propose that we should spend 21 billion hours a week as a planet playing video games .
they help us stay connected with people in our social network that we would otherwise grow distant from , if we weren &apos;t playing games together .
my brain started telling me , jane , you want to die .
even people were playing it for ter@@ minal diagno@@ ses like als .
it seems that somehow , a trau@@ matic event can un@@ lock our ability to lead a life with fewer regre@@ ts .
go !
all right , pick one , last quest : shake someone &apos;s hand for six seconds , or send someone a quick thank you by text , email , facebook or twitter . go !
pretty clever , right ?
on the right hand side , that bit there is part of an installation that is about 12 feet long .
by this stage the project had taken on a viral dimension of its own , which got completely beyond us .
the first one she did was k@@ nit@@ ting .
now mathematicians have answered that question .
it &apos;s a bit like this : imagine that we &apos;d only ever en@@ counter@@ ed e@@ uc@@ li@@ dean space .
and that &apos;s true . but it also goes deeper than that .
he believed that the cryst@@ al was the model for all kinds of representation .
so you can then map function onto structure , and then find out what the circu@@ it@@ ry &apos;s doing to generate that particular function .
and then what happens is , there &apos;s a blow to your head , dama@@ ging the cortex , allowing these lat@@ ent sexual ur@@ ges to emerge , fla@@ ming to the surface , and suddenly and in@@ exp@@ li@@ ca@@ bly you find yourself being sexually ar@@ ous@@ ed by your mother .
and that &apos;s fortunate , because we can put two electrodes on your palm and measure the change in skin resistance produced by swe@@ ating .
there &apos;s no delu@@ sion through the phone .
the phantom limb -- they &apos;ll say , &quot; but doctor , the phantom limb is paralyzed .
maybe you can reli@@ eve the phantom pain , the phantom cra@@ mp .
and he says , &quot; oh my god , my phantom is moving again . i don &apos;t believe this !
and i said -- i got worried , i said , my god , i mean i &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human subjects , eth@@ ics and all of that ?
bear in mind , these people are completely normal in other respe@@ cts .
now remember -- why does this happen ?
here , you &apos;ve got mar@@ tian alphabet .
it &apos;s kind of a well-@@ kept secret .
and i think that as we look at culture , we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are .
what &apos;s more , they are able to walk up@@ right for long distances .
you &apos;re happy .

the geome@@ tric mean of the mass of a pro@@ ton and the mass of the sun is 50 kilo@@ grams , within a factor of two of the mass of each person here .
and also , when a scientist makes a discovery , he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be .
but even in this concer@@ tin@@ a@@ ed cosmic perspective , our century is very , very special , the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet .

what was interesting about the article was people started comm@@ enting on the article , readers of the thing .
so some people got this sli@@ p of paper and five dollars .
they &apos;re also fairly wealthy and aff@@ lu@@ ent and all these other sorts of things .
perfectly nice thing to do .
i would be a jer@@ k and not tell you what it is , but in fact , it &apos;s central african republic .
and i know what you &apos;re all thinking about are do@@ d@@ ge@@ ball teams .
michael nor@@ ton : how to buy happiness
in sp@@ ite of the very clear anti-@@ israeli ide@@ ology of the new regime , the geo@@ political logic for their collaboration lived on , because they still had common threats .
the bush administration did not even respond .
the cry of &quot; raw data now ! &quot;
how can you use this stuff ?
so , now we have , immediately , a real-@@ time map showing where there are refugee camps -- rapidly became the best map to use if you &apos;re doing relief work in port@@ -@@ au@@ -@@ prince .
okay , so we have a democracy , no doubt , but it &apos;s dependent upon the le@@ sters and dependent upon the people .
there are rich le@@ sters , poor le@@ sters , black le@@ sters , white le@@ sters , not many women le@@ sters , but put that to the side for one second .
this is a system that &apos;s designed to save the status qu@@ o , including the status qu@@ o of big and inva@@ sive government .
so it &apos;s not that mine is the most important issue . it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s sol@@ vable , not by being a democr@@ at , not by being a republi@@ can .
a government dependent upon the people alone .
it began the space race .
i was sent to a place , a psy@@ ch ward , and in the psy@@ ch ward , everyone is doing their own one-@@ man show .
now recently , there &apos;s been development in this field .
this is a room full of intelligent people , highly sensitive .
i &apos;ll show you a computer model made by i@@ ain cou@@ z@@ in , a researcher at oxford , that shows how s@@ war@@ ms work .
information can be sent over half a kilome@@ ter away in a very short time through this mechanism .
for a long time it was not believed when the first western travel@@ ers , like sir fran@@ c@@ is dra@@ ke , went to th@@ ail@@ and and came back with tal@@ es of this unbelievable spect@@ ac@@ le .
what i have here are two empty water bottles .
now , that might seem a bit wh@@ im@@ si@@ cal , but this per@@ va@@ si@@ veness of this tendency towards spon@@ taneous order sometimes has unexpected consequences .
intervie@@ wer : right , so , at least this much ? oh , yes .
engineer : absolutely . intervie@@ wer : you thought , &quot; oh , bo@@ ther . &quot;
so already , the simul@@ ator is making me walk in exactly the same way as our witne@@ sses walked on the real bridge .
you don &apos;t see it in the newspaper every day .
so , i want to tell you that the piece of the good news is that the fo@@ w@@ ler apple is still out there .
in short , the answer is that in the future , in many countries , the col@@ dest growing seas@@ ons are going to be hot@@ ter than anything those crops have seen in the past .
we have collected and conser@@ ved a great deal of biological diversity , agricultural diversity , mostly in the form of seed , and we put it in seed banks , which is a fancy way of saying a free@@ zer .
when you open up the front door , this is what you &apos;re looking at . it &apos;s pretty simple . it &apos;s a hole in the ground .
agriculture takes 70 percent of fresh water supplies on earth .
it &apos;s time again to talk about &quot; in@@ convenient truth , &quot; a truth that everyone is concerned about , but nobody is willing to talk about .
another benefit of wi@@ -@@ fi , we learned yesterday about the benefits of wi@@ -@@ fi .
i want to start off by saying , hou@@ ston , we have a problem .
that has not happened at all in space flying .
three years , and we can &apos;t do that now . crazy .
and it will be sub-@@ orb@@ ital . and the reason it has to be sub-@@ orb@@ ital is , there is not solutions for adequ@@ ate safety to fly the public to orbit . the governments have been doing this -- three governments have been doing this for 45 years , and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died .
these people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area , and i think it &apos;s a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something -- but they &apos;re putting it in very -- areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability , and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore . and i think eventually it will allow us to colon@@ ize and to keep us from going extinct .
100 million bucks -- hey , i can go to the moon .
the technology revolution is opening the world .
now , what is openness ?
he viewed talent differently .
now , the third meaning and correspon@@ ding principle of openness is about sharing .
social media didn &apos;t create the revolution ; it was created by a new generation of young people who wanted jobs and hope and who didn &apos;t want to be treated as subjects anymore .
people didn &apos;t know about things .
it prote@@ cts the birds .
so why should we care about blood vessels ?
so here we go .
in effect , when we give cancer patients anti@@ angiogen@@ ic therapy -- here , an experimental drug for a gli@@ om@@ a , which is a type of brain tumor -- you can see that there are dramatic changes that occur when the tumor is being star@@ ved .
and , in fact , the first pione@@ ering treatments for people , as well as dogs , are already becoming available .
the active ingredient &apos;s res@@ ver@@ at@@ ro@@ l , it &apos;s also found in red wine .
now , i &apos;ve shown you a bunch of lab data , and so the real question is : what is the evidence in people that eating certain foods can reduce angiogenesis in cancer ?
the really , truly interesting thing about this is that we can &apos;t take these obese mice and make them lose more weight than what the normal mouse &apos;s weight is supposed to be .
for the last 20 years i &apos;ve been designing puzzles .
went on , and eventually decided to de@@ vote myself , full time , to that .
the artist m@@ .@@ c. es@@ cher explo@@ ited that in some of his wonderful prints .
well , let &apos;s first of all simpli@@ fy the v@@ ases illusion , make the thing on the right .
the first move is going to be what ?
but it takes some persist@@ ence .
why ? well , we aging boom@@ ers , baby boom@@ ers , we &apos;re eating our healthy food , we &apos;re exerci@@ sing . what about our minds ?
that &apos;s his hair . you get a lot of figu@@ re-@@ ground problems .
i think the whole world has essentially been brought up not to be a girl .
their stories were so horri@@ fic , and so mind-@@ blowing and so on the other side of human existence , that to be perfectly honest with you , i was sha@@ ttered .
i &apos;ve traveled , as i said , to many , many countries , and i &apos;ve seen , if we do what we do to the girl inside us then obviously it &apos;s horri@@ fic to think what we do to girls in the world .
i know a 14@@ -year-old girl in the ne@@ therlands , for example , who is deman@@ ding that she take a boat and go around the entire world by herself .
she taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like , and what a mu@@ til@@ ated vagina looked like .
and when she got to the house she was gree@@ ted .
it &apos;s all bad . my brothers get everything . &quot;
i re@@ jo@@ ice that it &apos;s still in my body .
thank you very much .
sent to prison , ad@@ am@@ antly insi@@ sting on his inno@@ cence , which he has consist@@ ently for 21 years .
this is looking directly across the street from where they were standing .
some of the teenagers said that in fact the car was 15 feet away when it shot .
and what does this example -- what &apos;s important to keep in mind for ourselves ?
and this blew his mind . literally . he checked into a san@@ it@@ arium .
so nature has this self-@@ similar structure .
well , i noticed that line is about where the only square building in the village is at .
first of all , i agree with mu@@ di@@ m@@ be &apos;s wonderful book , &quot; the invention of africa , &quot; that africa is an artificial invention of first colon@@ i@@ alism , and then op@@ posi@@ tional movements .
here &apos;s a wonderful frac@@ tal .
and one of them said , &quot; come here . i think i can help you out here . &quot;
so let me end with just a few words about applications that we &apos;ve found for this .
so if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work , we need look only no farther than africa to find these robust self-@@ organizing algorithms .
at 7 p.@@ m. on a sunday in hidden sp@@ rings , i@@ da@@ h@@ o , where the six members of the star@@ r family are sitting down to the high@@ light of their week : the family meeting .
he read 30 years of harvard business review before stu@@ mbling upon an article in 198@@ 6 called &quot; the new new product development game . &quot;
he said , &quot; you can &apos;t under@@ estimate the power of doing this . &quot;
it felt like we were kind of la@@ ying these underground cables that wouldn &apos;t light up their world for many years to come .
we &apos;ll have family breakfast . we &apos;ll meet for a bed@@ time s@@ n@@ ack .
so we said , &quot; okay , give us a reward and give us a punishment . okay ? &quot;
jim col@@ lin@@ s , the author of &quot; good to great , &quot; told me that successful human organizations of any kind have two things in common : they preserve the core , they stimul@@ ate progress .
researchers at e@@ mor@@ y gave children a simple &quot; what do you know &quot; test .
that story perfectly cap@@ tures for me the final lesson that i learned : happiness is not something we find , it &apos;s something we make .
a wind@@ shi@@ eld co@@ ating is going to give you about 1@@ 10 degrees .
and i &apos;m going to leave you with one last demonstration , but before i do that , i would like to say thank you , and think small .
and that was that she did two entire shows promot@@ ing that movie &quot; the secret . &quot;
when a word was mentioned , an image of it instantly appeared in his mind .
a world tele@@ graphy center -- imagine news , messages , sounds , images delivered to any point in the world instantly and wire@@ lessly .
it &apos;s been around for about 7@@ ,000 years .
again , we are making holes in the skull about the size of a di@@ me , putting an electro@@ de in , and then this electro@@ de is completely underneath the skin down to a pac@@ ema@@ ker in the chest , and with a remote control very much like a television remote control , we can adjust how much electricity we deliver to these areas of the brain .
so here he is .
so we went ahead and im@@ planted electrodes in patients with depression .
and indeed , at the top , you &apos;ll see before the surgery , the areas in blue are the areas that use less g@@ luc@@ ose than normal , pre@@ domin@@ antly the par@@ i@@ et@@ al and tempor@@ al lo@@ bes .
i get to do this all the time , and it &apos;s just incredible .
and they can be mode@@ led by a sp@@ r@@ ing-@@ mass system that we call the spring mass system because we &apos;re bi@@ ome@@ chan@@ ists . it &apos;s actually a po@@ go stick .
this is a collaboration we have with stanford .
we couldn &apos;t believe that it could do this . it said to us that if you could build a robot with very simple , sp@@ rin@@ gy legs , you could make it as man@@ eu@@ ver@@ able as any that &apos;s ever been built .
like if we had a piece of tape now , we &apos;d pe@@ el it this way .
but that &apos;s what we &apos;re limited to , at the moment .
and just recently we &apos;ve made a breakthrough , where we now believe we &apos;re going to be able to create the first synthetic , self-@@ cleaning , dry ad@@ he@@ sive . many companies are interested in this .
we also have another problem , which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal ful@@ fil@@ l@@ ment .
i don &apos;t have the right answer .
he re@@ ads one book of 12 and goes to a couple of lectures , mar@@ ches himself up to our room a couple days before the ex@@ am to get himself tu@@ to@@ red .
but it &apos;s not that simple .
and she said , &quot; i learned something today .
message number three : don &apos;t leave before you leave .
they &apos;re just not moving .
when people don &apos;t take their pills , when people don &apos;t follow doctors &apos; orders -- these are behavior problems .
they would get den@@ tures , and if you got den@@ tures , you weren &apos;t going to be able to eat cor@@ n-@@ on-@@ the-@@ co@@ b , you &apos;ll eat mus@@ h for the rest of your life .
this is still the way we &apos;re communicating messages about health .
we should probably slow down , and that point of action is probably now .
this is an approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at dar@@ t@@ mouth medical school , li@@ sa sch@@ war@@ tz and steven wo@@ lo@@ sh@@ in .
so that &apos;s what i want to walk you through .
so we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well .
but we &apos;re not using it . it &apos;s just sitting there .
i want to say a word for nature because we haven &apos;t talked that much about it the last couple days .
the bee is not calling the shots .
u@@ gh . mini@@ -@@ me .
now , the other use of this is practical .
he wa@@ its three days , and then we to@@ wed in something called the eg@@ g@@ mobile .
and the species in the soil go to work basically che@@ wing through those roots , de@@ compos@@ ing them -- the earth@@ worms , the fung@@ i , the bacteria -- and the result is new soil .
and so i say that i want to build a game layer on top of the world , but that &apos;s not quite true because it &apos;s already under construction ; it &apos;s already happening .
and if you &apos;re happy with that , fantastic .
so the first one -- the most famous ap@@ poin@@ tment dynamic in the world -- is something called happy hour .
you should get points for doing this on time .
why go from an a to an f or a b to a c ?
and we &apos;ve introduced a progre@@ ssion dynamic into it , where , by going to the same place over and over , by doing challenges , by engaging with the business , you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen , and you eventually un@@ lock rewards .
this next decade is the decade of games .
so you can see : here we are in the u.s. , and they &apos;re all coming up red .
and if we can switch to slides -- all right , here we go .
they run google ads , and we just give them the ad credit so they can let organizations know .
you can see , even though the u.s. is still the majority here -- though , by the way , sear@@ ch@@ -@@ wise , it &apos;s only about 30 percent of our traffic -- but it &apos;s already going to japan , and the u.k. , and europe , and all the rest of the countries .
i think usually , as companies get bigger , they find it really hard to have small , innovative projects .
fro@@ o@@ gle lets you search shopping information , and blog@@ ger lets you publish things .
but the idea is , like , on a newspaper , for example , we show you relevant ads .
so , &quot; related sear@@ ches , &quot; right there . you can &apos;t see it that well , but we decided we should put in this feature into our ad@@ sense ads , called &quot; related sear@@ ches . &quot;
now this rather old photo up there is actually the first project i was ever hired to do , something like 25 years ago .
and to do that meant creating the flat@@ test gra@@ di@@ ents that had ever yet been made , which meant building long vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ ts across river val@@ le@@ ys -- this is actually the vi@@ ad@@ uc@@ t across the th@@ am@@ es at ma@@ i@@ den@@ head -- and long tun@@ nels such as the one at box , in wil@@ t@@ shi@@ re .
what makes technology useful and us@@ able ?
and instead of inst@@ all@@ ing the large-scale machines used by western producers , they used low-cost ca@@ d / ca@@ m prototy@@ ping technology .
now the industrial systems of bru@@ nel &apos;s time have run their course , and indeed they are part of the problem today .
so for me , this project shows kind of how far we can go from some of those sort of small things that i was working on at the beginning of my career .
in response , he gave me an even more cour@@ te@@ ous version of the same explanation .
people must choose for themselves , sometimes sticking to their guns , regardless of what other people want or recommend .
the assumption then that we do best when the individual self choo@@ ses only holds when that self is clearly divided from others .
of course , you and i know that coke is the better choice .
it &apos;s not a mar@@ ker of liber@@ ation , but of suff@@ o@@ cation by meaning@@ less minu@@ ti@@ a@@ e .
in france , the doctors decided whether and when the life support would be removed , while in the united states , the final decision re@@ sted with the parents .
but the history books and the daily news tell us it doesn &apos;t always work out that way .
and so one time i was in a beauty sal@@ on , and i was trying to decide between two very light sha@@ des of pink .
she@@ ena i@@ y@@ eng@@ ar studies how we make choices -- and how we feel about the choices we make . at ted@@ global , she talks about both trivial choices and profound ones , and shares her gr@@ ound@@ breaking research that has un@@ covered some surprising attitudes about our decisions .
then i was so happy that i kept playing with the robot , and so you see the robot has a front ru@@ dder here .
so i brought to you for the first time on the ted stage prote@@ i number eight . it &apos;s not the last one , but it &apos;s a good one for making demo@@ s .
this is a proud member of prote@@ i from korea , and on the right side , this is a multi@@ ple@@ -@@ ma@@ sts design proposed by a team in mexico .
when senior fellow ce@@ sa@@ r har@@ ada heard about the devastating effects of the b@@ p oil spill in the gulf of mexico in 2010 , he quit his dream job and moved to new or@@ le@@ ans to develop a more efficient way to so@@ ak up the oil . he designed a highly man@@ eu@@ ver@@ able , flexible boat capable of cleaning large trac@@ ts quickly . but rather than turn a profit , he has op@@ ted to open-source the design .
ph : there &apos;s been an une@@ asy relationship between the tv business and the tech business , really ever since they both turned about 30 .
i mean , how did a machine that was built for accoun@@ ting and arti@@ ll@@ ery mor@@ ph into media ?
enter the atomic bomb .
and then , the 9@@ 2 nuclear power plants that it would take to provide the power would fill up the rest of los angeles .
then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set , and ru@@ b it out from the center to the corners , like this .
if you sub@@ stitu@@ te the word blo@@ go@@ sphere , of the internet today , it is very true that his understanding is probably very enlighten@@ ing now . let &apos;s listen in to him .
and into that fer@@ ment came the micro@@ processor .
this method allows you to use existing vide@@ o@@ dis@@ c materials in ways which suit your specific needs and interests .
in 19@@ 3@@ 9 , the radio corporation of america introduced television .
it &apos;s a customer , it &apos;s an audience , it &apos;s a person who &apos;s particip@@ ating .
voice 2 : well , there goes the neighborhood .
and so every time a new medium arri@@ ves , the old medium is the content , and it is highly obser@@ vable , highly no@@ ti@@ ce@@ able , but the real , real rough@@ ing up and ma@@ ssa@@ ging is done by the new medium , and it is ignored .
i was walking around on the streets of am@@ ster@@ dam and i recognized , you know , the big story from am@@ ster@@ dam isn &apos;t what &apos;s in the design stores , it &apos;s what &apos;s out on the streets , and maybe it &apos;s self-@@ explan@@ atory , but a city that hasn &apos;t been taken over by modern@@ ism , that &apos;s pre@@ served its kind of architecture and character , and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way in which people get around and where pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an rights are protected .
it takes your attention ; it has a great amount of emotion ; it star@@ es back at you the way that a figure might .
the dutch are good also , but the it@@ ali@@ ans are good .
and i do think pattern has the capability of eradi@@ cating some of the most evil forces of society , such as bad form in restaurants , but quite seriously , it was a statement to me that one thing that you do , sort of , see is the aggressive nature of the industrial world has produced -- kind of , large masses of things , and when you -- in mono@@ culture , and i think the pre@@ ser@@ vation of diversity in culture is something that &apos;s important to us .
rob for@@ bes , the founder of design within reach , shows a gallery of sna@@ p@@ shots that in@@ form his way of seeing the world . char@@ ming ju@@ x@@ ta@@ positions , found art , urban patterns -- this sli@@ de@@ show will open your eyes to the world around you .
so i built model airplanes .
and for the following 25 years , living in italy , living in america , i do@@ led out a piece of this roman@@ ce to anybody who &apos;d pay for it -- this sense , this aesthetic feeling , for the experience rev@@ ol@@ ving around a designed object .
and that &apos;s the way i work now .
he reached down . he pulled a le@@ ver . and the chair s@@ ank down .
would everybody put their hand under their bottom and feel their tail@@ bone ?
ide@@ ally you want to put the head support in the c@@ ran@@ ial area , right there .
now let &apos;s assume you go on holi@@ day .
that &apos;s two days ago .
clearly the product you &apos;ve got has got to be safe to humans .
a single female will lay about up to 100 eggs at a time , up to about 500 in her lifetime .
so fre@@ ight costs aren &apos;t our biggest problem .
i found myself in a hospital in an inten@@ si@@ ve-@@ care ward , re@@ cu@@ per@@ ating from emergency surgery .
so , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody asks you , &quot; where do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?
no doctor , can i remember , ever asking me , &quot; where have you lived ? &quot;
and all of those black dots are all of the toxic release invent@@ ories that are monit@@ ored by the ep@@ a .
and i would say he got it right almost a decade ago .
i am the em@@ per@@ or of oran@@ ges . i am the em@@ per@@ or of oran@@ ges . &quot;
i &apos;m going to start by asking you a question : is anyone familiar with the blue algae problem ?
cell memb@@ ran@@ es are phosphor@@ us@@ -based : these are called phosp@@ holi@@ pi@@ ds .
you &apos;re going to tell me it &apos;s wa@@ ste@@ ful .
what are we to do ? we are faced with a paradox .
and over time , this mushroom has evolved and adapted to seek out even the tin@@ iest trace of phosphorus , and to put it to use , to make it available to the plant .
my@@ cor@@ r@@ hi@@ za was used in one field but not in the other .
so , examples like chri@@ stop@@ her wre@@ n &apos;s king &apos;s cross : you can see that the structural forces of the va@@ ul@@ ting get artic@@ ul@@ ated as lines , so you &apos;re really actually seeing the expression of structural force and form .
now , typically you &apos;d think that they would all be the same : like , the chairs you &apos;re sitting in would all be the same dimension .
and here we &apos;ve broken the 500 apartments up into small neighborhoods , and differenti@@ ated those neighborhoods .
that way , each one of these tools we could pay for with a few hundred dollars , and get incredible variation in the components .
finally , i &apos;d like to just show you some of the effects of using digital fab@@ ri@@ cation .
if we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world , we can go to the bo@@ li@@ vi@@ an edge of the amazon , here also in 197@@ 5 , and if you look really carefully , there &apos;s a thin white line through that kind of se@@ am , and there &apos;s a l@@ one farmer out there in the middle of the pri@@ me@@ val jun@@ gle .
well , the color@@ a@@ do on a typical day in the 1950s , this is just , you know , not a floo@@ d , not a d@@ rought , kind of an average day , it looks something like this .
let &apos;s put it that way .
and yet , we don &apos;t talk about it very much .
the green areas here show where corn yi@@ elds , just showing corn as an example , are already really high , probably the maximum you could find on earth today for that climate and soil , but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where we &apos;re only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the yield you should be able to get .
we need to face &apos; the other in@@ convenient truth . &apos; a global crisis in agriculture .
and there &apos;s nothing we do that is more crucial to our survival .
and i thought she &apos;d say , &quot; oh , you know , up the la@@ go@@ on somewhere , or maybe across africa , &quot; but you &apos;ll be happy to know she said it came from here , it comes from the north sea .
so it &apos;s vast . but it should come with an a@@ ster@@ is@@ k , and the a@@ ster@@ is@@ k is that it exclu@@ des two thirds of the workers of the world .
they &apos;re going to ed@@ dy in la@@ gos .
first , it would be to understand that it could be considered a cooperative , and this is a thought from the braz@@ i@@ lian legal scho@@ lar ro@@ ber@@ to man@@ ga@@ be@@ ir@@ a un@@ ger .
there are also some children who are born without arms , called con@@ gen@@ ital limb def@@ ici@@ ency .
there are several available on the market , and here you see a few .
imagine , with somebody who &apos;s lost their whole arm , we still have four major nerves that go down your arm .
and i challenge anybody in the room to make their chest go like this .
you see him with his original device on the left there after eight months of use , and on the right , it is two months .
i could work them just by my thoughts .
ak : so i have the el@@ bow that goes up and down .
here &apos;s am@@ anda using an arm made by de@@ ka research corporation .
but look at all the electrodes around it .
to@@ d@@ d ku@@ i@@ ken : a prosthetic arm that &quot; feels &quot;
also , research within the continent is a lot easier to conduct due to wide@@ spread poverty , en@@ de@@ mic diseases and in@@ adequ@@ ate health care systems .
public accountability needs to be promot@@ ed through transparency and independent review by non@@ govern@@ mental and international organizations as appropriate .
now , there are around a thousand trucks and bu@@ ses and cars there .
and , more importantly , they &apos;re well-@@ dressed .
where it &apos;s blue and it &apos;s green , it means the water is really cold .
and so we have this penguin project . the wildlife conservation society has funded me along with a lot of individuals over the last 27 years to be able to produce these kinds of maps .
because we &apos;ve solved the problem in ch@@ u@@ but provin@@ ce , which is like a state in ar@@ gent@@ ina where pun@@ ta tom@@ bo is -- so that &apos;s about 1,000 kilometers of coast@@ line -- but we haven &apos;t solved the problem in northern ar@@ gent@@ ina , ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay and brazil .
tur@@ bo &apos;s never been fed .
here &apos;s a female that &apos;s in a hur@@ ry . she &apos;s got food .
for them , nations , countries , boundaries , borders still matter a great deal , and often viol@@ ently .
as you can see on this map , russia is still the largest country in the world .
they set up their own ba@@ z@@ a@@ ars and medical clinics .
specifically , it targets japan and korea and australia , countries that are strong al@@ lies of the united states .
so what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world ?
what might ? i believe that what might solve the problem is infrastructure .
and i as@@ sure you it &apos;s every bit as important to them as it might have been to colon@@ iz@@ ers and im@@ peri@@ alists .
in 2004 , 15 new countries joined the e.@@ u .
the post-@@ colon@@ ial entropy that is happening around the world is accelerating , and i expect more such changes to occur in the map as the states fra@@ gment .
many people think the lines on the map no longer matter , but para@@ g k@@ han@@ na says they do . using maps of the past and present , he explains the root causes of border conflicts worldwide and pro@@ poses simple yet c@@ un@@ ning solutions for each .
and next you &apos;re going to see the long-@@ lived mu@@ tant when it &apos;s young .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s like . and you would never know .
now you &apos;ve all heard of at least insulin .
so it &apos;s really interesting , and it makes sense in a way , that they &apos;re still young , so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old ?
that &apos;s how it works . that &apos;s why we don &apos;t see the long lifespan , until we have the d@@ af@@ -@@ 2 mu@@ tant .
and that &apos;s the case all over the world , as you can see from these stars .
although you &apos;re looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me , what you could do now pretty well in the lab , if you were allowed eth@@ ically , is start a human life from scratch with alter@@ ed genes that would make it live for a lot longer ?
if you look at birds , which live a long time , cells from the birds tend to be more resistant to a lot of different environmental stre@@ sses like high temperature or hydrogen per@@ oxide , things like that .
as you can see , it &apos;s impossible to read .
here &apos;s another good article about a new campaign oppos@@ ing pri@@ va@@ tiz@@ ation of trans@@ it without any contact information for the campaign .
which leads us to the last one , which is our elections .
i can see i &apos;ve got my work cut out for me here .
now to begin to overcome our ignor@@ ance of the role of brain chemistry in brain circu@@ it@@ ry , it &apos;s helpful to work on what we biologists call &quot; model organisms , &quot; animals like fruit flies and laboratory mice , in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques to mo@@ lec@@ ularly identify and pin@@ point specific classes of neurons , as you heard about in all@@ an jones &apos;s talk this morning .
valence means good or bad , positive or negative .
you can train a fly to avoid an od@@ or , shown here in blue , if you pair that od@@ or with a shock .
modern psychiatric drugs treat the chemistry of the whole brain , but neuro@@ biologist david anderson believes in a more nu@@ anced view of how the brain functions . he illu@@ min@@ ates new research that could lead to targe@@ ted psychiatric medi@@ cations -- that work better and avoid side effects . how &apos;s he doing it ? for a start , by making a bunch of fruit flies angry .
so we set up an experiment where@@ by we put a naked volunteer in a large ca@@ ge , and in that ca@@ ge we released mosquitos to see where they were b@@ iting on the body of that person .
so the problem that we face with this is that , throughout the landscape , all these po@@ ols of water with the lar@@ va@@ e , they are sca@@ ttered all over the place , which makes it very hard for an in@@ spe@@ ctor like this to actually find all these breeding sites and treat them with inse@@ c@@ tici@@ des .
here we go .
but not all patients on the transplant wait list are so fortunate .
and in my mind , i realized as a surgical pione@@ er that the purpose of my position of influence was surely to speak up for those who have no influence .
and so guess what , scientists around the world and in the labs are rac@@ ing to convert aging adult cells -- aging adult cells from you and me -- they are rac@@ ing to re@@ program these cells back into more useful i@@ ps cells .
stem cells may be used to deliver growth factors to repair damaged heart muscle or be differenti@@ ated into heart muscle cells to restore heart function .
and here are the results of this wonderful project that is the system in vene@@ zu@@ ela .
so what &apos;s going on when it doesn &apos;t ?
but here &apos;s what &apos;s going on here .
yeah .
and for the good of your relationships , i would encourage you to do the same .
but we don &apos;t know where , since we don &apos;t know how to read the pattern .
first , it &apos;s clearly a non-@@ inva@@ sive , wireless form of communication .
you &apos;re familiar with these cells because they are the ones that frustr@@ ate you when you try to sw@@ at the fly .
whenever a fly reaches the mid@@ point of the chamber where the two od@@ or streams meet , it has to make a decision .
whenever it comes up to the mid@@ point , it pa@@ uses , it carefully scans the od@@ or interface as if it was sni@@ ff@@ ing out its environment , and then it turns around .
the other piece of good news , for a scientist at least , is that much remains to be discovered .
and it &apos;s dependent on passive patients who just take it and don &apos;t ask any questions .
thomas bat@@ u@@ i@@ k : hi there , eric .
and you just saw a little bit of the first two with my interaction with dr. ba@@ ti@@ u@@ k .
i had my own heart sc@@ are years ago in graduate school , when we &apos;re under treatment for the kidney , and suddenly , they &apos;re like , &quot; oh , we think you have a heart problem . &quot;
these population studies that we &apos;ve done have created tons of miracle drugs that have saved millions of lives , but the problem is that health care is treating us as a@@ ver@@ ages , not unique individuals , because at the end of the day , the patient is not the same thing as the population who are studied . that &apos;s what &apos;s leading to the guess@@ work .
so &quot; thank you &quot; feel likes a really tr@@ ite word , but thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving my life .
that &apos;s kel@@ lar au@@ tum@@ n , my former ph.d. student , professor now at lewis and clar@@ k , literally giving his first-@@ born child up for this test .
oh . one thing i want to point out is , look at sti@@ ck@@ y@@ bo@@ t .
and when i went back to research this , i realized that one of the great ted moments in the past , from na@@ than , we &apos;ve talked about an active tail .
for those of you who remember your physics , that &apos;s a zero-@@ ang@@ ul@@ ar-@@ momentum ri@@ gh@@ ting response . but it &apos;s like a cat .
so we can man@@ eu@@ ver this way .
but then as it gets closer to the tree , look at the close@@ -up . and see if you can see it land .
so i will spend a little time at the end .
well , the problem is that we &apos;ve got very complicated forces in the climate system .
this was -- this is south of the ant@@ arctic circle .
it took about 10 years to put this project together .
we &apos;ve actually changed the temperature in the last century just the right amount .
and it been growing for about 600 years .
the coral can take us back hundreds and thousands of years .
so i &apos;ll close with a short discussion of ocean aci@@ di@@ fication .
now , what that means is that all of the organisms that live in the sea have evolved in this chemo@@ stat@@ ted ocean , that &apos;s the reason that they &apos;re not able to respond or adapt to this rapid aci@@ di@@ fication that &apos;s going on right now .
the idea goes like this : imagine space is a sub@@ str@@ ate of all there is .
he said , if i want to describe one more force , maybe i need one more dimension .
some of you guys will fix that one day , but anything that &apos;s not flat on a screen is a new dimension , goes smaller , smaller , smaller , and way down in the microscopic dep@@ ths of space itself , this is the idea , you could have additional cur@@ led up dimensions -- here is a little shape of a circle -- so small that we don &apos;t see them .
this something else is this dancing fil@@ ament of energy .
and that question is this : when we look around the world , as scientists have done for the last hundred years , there appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe .
and if you watch these little fel@@ lows vibr@@ ating around -- they &apos;ll be there in a second -- right there , notice that they way they vibr@@ ate is affected by the geometry of the extra dimensions .
and now string theory comes along and says , yes , gravity , quantum mechanics , electro@@ magne@@ tism , all together in one package , but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see .
what i want to talk about is not that context is everything , but why is context everything .
the one on the left comes from an orange surface , under direct light , facing to the right , viewed through a sort of a blu@@ ish medium .
so , if i could have the lights down up here .
but i &apos;m not going to change anything within those boxes , except their meaning .
move your eyes around , b@@ link , maybe close one eye .
and they land on the flower . they stick their tongue in there , called a pro@@ bo@@ sc@@ is , and they drink sugar water .
and you &apos;ll see there is a line , a fa@@ int line going across that image .
so , now , what i want to do : i &apos;m going to put the middle nine surfaces here under yellow illu@@ mination by simply putting a filter behind them .
so if you look at security from economic terms , it &apos;s a tra@@ de-@@ off .
and i think that &apos;s a fundamentally interesting question .
so you can imagine how that works .
there &apos;s no real word for stuff that makes us secure , but doesn &apos;t make us feel secure .
i have feeling and reality .
i was born in new york city .
intuitive is just another word for familiar .
an example , a great example , is the risk of smoking .
strong feelings can create a model .
i mean really though , information seems like our best hope .
i said , &quot; well , that &apos;s kind of neat .
couldn &apos;t do it . could not wait .
and let me show you what happened .
jo@@ ac@@ him de pos@@ ada : don &apos;t eat the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low !
this was after 9 / 11 ; the city was in tough times .
and we &apos;ve already started construction on section two .
let me show you a slide here which illustr@@ ates the character of conflicts since 194@@ 6 until today .
and my country re@@ lies on its security through military alli@@ ance , that &apos;s clear .
my point is that you don &apos;t have to be neutral to talk .
i think that is wrong .
so what can we learn from all of this ?
it &apos;s crucial to understand , i believe , because of technology and because of globalization , societies from bottom@@ -up .
i said , &quot; no , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s penguin shit . &quot;
and recently , i was in ea@@ ster island , which is an incredibly beautiful place , and an incredibly mysterious place , because no matter where you go in ea@@ ster island , you &apos;re struck by these stat@@ ues , called the mo@@ ai .
how long have they been standing in what positions ?
so , this device here is an in@@ vi@@ sibility clo@@ ak .
this subjects food to a force about 50,000 times that of normal gravity , and oh boy , does it clar@@ i@@ fy chicken stock .
i mean , can you imagine ? e.@@ t. &apos; s ph@@ oning home , and i &apos;m not , like , there ? you know , horrible !
now , this is what ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ ur@@ us re@@ x looks like in my living room .
so , there &apos;s more and more activity near the boat , and all of a sudden somebody shou@@ ts , &quot; what &apos;s that in the water ? &quot;
having explained those , that will set up for what i think will be a different idea about how to go about treating cancer .
so what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an asian person and a european person by looking at their ingredients list .
but sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that .
i mean , i see patients dying every day because we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on inside of them .
so this is the signature out of which we &apos;re trying to get patterns .
the problem is that , in cancer , there isn &apos;t something else that &apos;s inside of you .
so your house is dealing with lea@@ ks all the time , but it &apos;s fix@@ ing them . it &apos;s dra@@ ining them out and so on .
so thank you very much .
february 4@@ th , we posted it on our website . this was before super tu@@ es@@ day .
stage one is a group where people systematically se@@ ver relationships from functional tribes , and then pool together with people who think like they do .
if that &apos;s how you talked , imagine what kind of work would get done .
here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation .
there is , in fact , another stage .
we &apos;re great ! who is not great ? england ! &quot;
one of the people we interviewed was frank jor@@ dan , former mayor of san francisco . before that he was chief of police in san francisco .
pretty much everybody else who does pol@@ ls .
i &apos;m going to read a few stri@@ ps .
it &apos;s why they leave lights on around the house .
it was not until the 14@@ th century that an italian pain@@ ter recognized the lap as a gre@@ ci@@ an temple , up@@ hol@@ stered in fle@@ sh and clo@@ th .
apri@@ co@@ t hal@@ ves like the ears of cher@@ ubi@@ m .
and it &apos;s too cere@@ br@@ al to anim@@ ate gu@@ ts and hearts and behavior when the going gets rough .
and in that light , for the religious , compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery -- encouraging us not just to see beauty , but perhaps also to look for the face of god in the moment of suffering , in the face of a stran@@ ger , in the face of the vibr@@ ant religious other .
je@@ an van@@ ier says that his work , like the work of other people -- his great , be@@ loved , late friend mother ter@@ es@@ a -- is never in the first instance about changing the world ; it &apos;s in the first instance about changing ourselves .
but he watched physicists and chemi@@ sts become the pur@@ ve@@ y@@ ors of weapons of mass destruction in the early 20th century .
rac@@ he@@ l na@@ om@@ i re@@ men is a better doctor because of her life-@@ long struggle with cro@@ h@@ n &apos;s disease .
but i re@@ c@@ ited a che@@ er . i re@@ c@@ ited a che@@ er along with everybody else .
it &apos;s different from being shy .
and this turns out to have a special power all its own , because people could feel that these leaders were at the hel@@ m , not because they enjoyed dire@@ cting others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at ; they were there because they had no choice , because they were driven to do what they thought was right .
this is no surprise though if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology .
and they feature as their role models really great sal@@ es@@ men .
and even away from the po@@ dium , when you called him to say hello , he would often end the conversation pre@@ mat@@ u@@ rely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time .
this is especially important for ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted children too .
and then i &apos;ll come back to the beginning , and tell you a little bit more -- hopefully convince you -- that i believe that in today &apos;s world , it is really important for business leaders not only to have an idea of what their business is all about , but to have a passion for something that is meaningful .
so , one of our pas@@ sions in our company , and now one of my personal pas@@ sions , is to be able to really work hard at making the technology useful , accessible and affordable .
as a matter of fact , we think reaching 100 percent is very do@@ able , even before the 20@@ 15 ti@@ me@@ frame . in other parts of emerging countries , such as india and china , the progress has been good -- has been solid , has been good . but in places that are not as developed , places like africa , latin america and other places in the world , the progress has been rather slow . as a matter of fact , i was just recently visit@@ ing south africa .
what i mean by that is that in some parts of the world , the government plays a key role in the development of technology .
one example of this has been the one laptop per child .
you have to be a better husband than i was , because that &apos;s how you make progress . &quot; and now he began to make sense .
i meet a lot of people who are very smart , and say , &quot; but why can &apos;t i figure out my problems ? &quot;
i started it with one other family in 19@@ 80 .
and i asked this guy , i said , &quot; well , do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation ?
i don &apos;t own a gu@@ es@@ thou@@ se .
it &apos;s all about more , having more .
when you read this pra@@ yer , it sounds incredibly selfish , self-@@ cen@@ tered .
now , they &apos;re 13 miles up the road in santa ana .
but he doesn &apos;t do mirac@@ les just to show off .
last year , i was invited to speak at n@@ ba all-@@ stars game .
if you &apos;re wired to make deals , you make deals .
and i don &apos;t mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade -- they don &apos;t go .
her mother had not gone to primary school .
and somewhere in the middle of south da@@ k@@ ota , i turn to my friend and i ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2,000 miles .
and finally , i want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellectual and creative leap you can make .
but there &apos;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well -- and this one is cultural .
well the wrong side of her body is in band@@ ages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one .
the miracle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
when it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
and to me , if you really want to re@@ discover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terrified space of ri@@ ght@@ ness and look around at each other and look out at the va@@ st@@ ness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; wow , i don &apos;t know .
one of the ir@@ on@@ ies of this whole system is we &apos;re discus@@ sing what to do about a system that we don &apos;t understand . we don &apos;t even know what oil is . we don &apos;t know where oil comes from . i mean , literally , it &apos;s still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from . the best assumption , and one of the best guess@@ es in this stuff , is that this stuff comes out of this stuff , that these things absor@@ b sunlight , rot under pressure for millions of years , and you get these black rivers .
what is this ? this is the first transplant of naked dna , where you take an entire dna operating system out of one cell , in@@ ser@@ t it into a different cell , and have that cell boo@@ t up as a separate species . that &apos;s one month old . you will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff .
i happened to buy that mot@@ el about three months after vi@@ vi@@ an started working there .
but given my be@@ fu@@ dd@@ led state of mind , i ended up in the self-@@ help section very quickly .
they didn &apos;t even see the in@@ tangible stuff higher up the pyramid .
so as i spent time with leaders in the gn@@ h movement , i got to really understand what they &apos;re doing .
actually , in fact , if you look in the dictionary , many dic@@ tion@@ aries define pursuit as to &quot; chase with hosti@@ l@@ ity . &quot;
we &apos;re asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity .
in fact , as leaders , what we need to learn is that we can influence the quality of that unit of production by creating the conditions for our employees to live their calling .
b@@ l : all right . one , two , three .
right ? if you go down below on a boat , your inner ears are you telling you you &apos;re moving . your eyes , because it &apos;s moving in regi@@ ster with the boat , say i &apos;m standing still .
now here , i want to share the stage with someone quite special . right ?
b@@ l : &quot; can you help me , henry ? &quot; what good scientist says that , right ?
so we asked larry and nat@@ ali@@ e he@@ m@@ pe@@ l to write a comment@@ ary situ@@ ating the findings for scientists , right , putting in the refer@@ ences , and we sub@@ mit it to biology letters .
b@@ l : this is the ep@@ it@@ ome of technology . right . okay .
this is terrible , this oil -- it &apos;s in the water .
we feel so good about ourselves .
biom@@ im@@ ic@@ ry , which is something that is an emerging science , winds up being a very important social justice idea .
california has one of the highest in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rates of all the 50 states .
it was a trying and scary thing for a young kid to be going through .
it &apos;s bad enough on a highway , what &apos;s it going to be like to be in the air ?
this is the world -- there won &apos;t be you as a pilot . and i know the pi@@ lots in the audience aren &apos;t going to like that -- and i &apos;ve had a lot of bad feedback from people who want to be up there , flying around and experiencing that .
wonderful engine .
twenty-@@ three percent said , &quot; yes , as soon as possible . &quot;
wires suck , they really do .
what dr. sol@@ jac@@ ic figured out how to do was separate the co@@ ils in a trans@@ former to a greater distance than the size of those trans@@ for@@ mers using this technology , which is not dis@@ similar from the way an opera singer sha@@ t@@ ters a glass on the other side of the room .
and then finally , electric vehicles .
imagine , you get one of these things . you want to hang them on the wall .
and no@@ ki@@ a as well .
so what happens to all these tox@@ ins when we die ?
we want to eat , not be eaten by , our food .
thank you .
we followed my job , and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn &apos;t do .
they &apos;re ex@@ otic . they &apos;re experimental .
so what do we make of all of this ?
it &apos;s so clear , yet they &apos;re in denial . &quot;
hosp@@ ice was for people who were dying , and ter@@ ence wasn &apos;t dying .
it &apos;s part of our dna as humans , and maybe it &apos;s time our healthcare system -- doctors , patients , insurance companies , us , started accoun@@ ting for the power of that hope .
well , we collect data from satellites , from airplanes , from ground vehicles , from people .
this process is a very calcul@@ ated process .
microsoft &apos;s stephen law@@ ler gives a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind tour of virtual earth , moving up , down and through its hyper@@ -@@ real c@@ it@@ y@@ scapes with da@@ zz@@ lin@@ gly flu@@ id@@ ity , a remarkable fe@@ at that requires st@@ agger@@ ing amounts of data to bring into focus .
you need also state ownership , especially of land assets , in order to build and roll out infra@@ structures very quickly .
this is a very little known fact about the two countries .
by that comparison , democracy looks very , very good in terms of economic growth .
this is the world development index indi@@ ca@@ tor data in the early 1990s .
these are the two pictures taken of gar@@ ment factories in gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong provin@@ ce and gar@@ ment factories in india .
but nevertheless , the system has moved in a more liberal direction , moved in a more democratic direction .
i believe that the political re@@ forms are a must for china to maintain its growth .
i &apos;ve been spending a lot of time thinking about coffe@@ e@@ houses for the last five years , because i &apos;ve been kind of on this quest to investi@@ gate this question of where good ideas come from .
and what they noticed was they don &apos;t have a lot of dv@@ r@@ s , they don &apos;t have a lot of micro@@ waves , but they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars on the road .
this is what your office should look like , is part of my message here .
and darwin kept these cop@@ i@@ ous no@@ te@@ books where he wrote down every little idea he had , every little hun@@ ch .
and so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues , and everybody &apos;s like , &quot; no , i hadn &apos;t thought of doing that .
could you go the other way ?
this shift is the most striking in the u.s. and in the u.k. , but it &apos;s a global phenomenon .
so we &apos;re living in the age of sur@@ ging income inequality , especially at the top .
we have super@@ star ban@@ kers .
again , this is no mere hypothe@@ tical .
the dy@@ stop@@ ia that wor@@ ries me is a universe in which a few geni@@ uses invent google and its il@@ k and the rest of us are emp@@ loyed giving them ma@@ ssa@@ ges .
there &apos;s many of them up there .
one in a hundred .
and this one &apos;s the biggest growth industry of all , and at least six out of 10 of the people in this room will die in this form , which is the d@@ wind@@ ling of capacity with increasing fra@@ il@@ ty , and fra@@ il@@ ty &apos;s an inevitable part of aging , and increasing fra@@ il@@ ty is in fact the main thing that people die of now , and the last few years , or the last year of your life is spent with a great deal of disability , unfortunately .
the small idea is , let &apos;s all of us engage more with this in the way that jas@@ on has illustr@@ ated .
it depri@@ ves eu@@ than@@ asia of its oxygen supply .
my family was on a road trip and we were in the grand cany@@ on .
and this is really what i want to talk to you about today -- about cancer .
so , this really changed my view of looking at cancer .
tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels .
so , is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue , but once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue , m@@ yo@@ d acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become skeletal muscle cells ?
and the grandmother had never let any we@@ ster@@ ners ever see her .
and remember this picture , because i &apos;m going to show you another picture later , but you can see how much she looks like her grandmother , although she looks so western .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m 28 years old , and i live in hot@@ els , and i &apos;m not married . &quot;
so , i went back to korea , and i went back to hy@@ un-@@ so@@ ok &apos;s village , and she was gone .
and the more i tried talking to him , the less friendly he was getting .
i just think that -- what little i know about the situation , she has very little chance here of having the kind of life that you probably would like her to have . &quot;
and he said , &quot; the second day she was here she made up a list of all of the names of the older kids and the younger kids .
and the third night , we came back , we &apos;d just gone out to dinner , where you saw the pictures , and we got to the front desk and the guy at the front desk said , &quot; there &apos;s no other free rooms on your floor tonight , so if you want to put the kids five flo@@ ors below you , there &apos;s a room there . &quot;
and the whole room filled with smoke in about two seconds .
and i remember , nat@@ asha didn &apos;t want us opening the door -- sorry , i was trying not to open the door , because we &apos;d spent so much time barri@@ ca@@ ding the room .
this is a tri@@ -@@ star , and so they let nat@@ asha actually sit in the jump seat .
gene even did a little tile work in the kitchen , which was that , &quot; once upon a time , there was a beautiful girl that came from hills of korea to live happily ever after in atlan@@ ta . &quot;
thank you all of you .
a lot has happened in the last few years , and let &apos;s start with the planets .
in fact , even back during the anci@@ ents , the solar system in that sense would look on a diagram like this .
most of these are candidates .
so the question is : is that chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something which depends on the planet ?
this understanding of chemistry actually can help us with our daily lives .
can you imagine how small it is ?
let &apos;s start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one , with synthetic biology being the way to transform both our environment and our future .
then , uganda started to turn back , whereas z@@ im@@ bab@@ we sky@@ rocke@@ ted , and some years later south africa had a terrible rise of hiv frequency .
not the drug in itself , but the treatment and the care which is needed around it .
there &apos;s a lot of things that we thought , that now , good research , done by african institutions and researchers together with the international researchers , show that that &apos;s not the case .
un@@ aids have done good data available , finally , about the spread of hiv .
hans ro@@ sling un@@ ve@@ ils new data visu@@ als that un@@ tan@@ gle the complex risk factors of one of the world &apos;s dead@@ li@@ est diseases : hiv . he argues that preventing trans@@ missions -- not drug treatments -- is the key to ending the epidemic .
it &apos;s based on purcha@@ sing power par@@ ity .
we know that &apos;s wrong , because we conducted two great natural experiments in the 20th century to see if geo@@ graphy mat@@ tered more than institutions .
let &apos;s call them the killer apps .
meanwhile , there &apos;s no scientific revolution anywhere else .
that &apos;s the consumer society , and it prope@@ ls economic growth more than even technological change itself .
any society can adopt these institutions , and when they do , they achieve what the west achieved after 1@@ 500 -- only faster .
that &apos;s so true .
and that &apos;s all we seem to be caring about recently .
so what this figure shows is that spiders date back to almost 3@@ 80 million years .
these can be grou@@ ped into seven categories .
so i &apos;ve colored in the g@@ ly@@ cines again in green , al@@ an@@ ine in red , and the ser@@ ines , the letter s , in purple . and you can see that the top repeat unit can be explained almost entirely by green and red , and the bottom repeat unit has a substan@@ tial amount of purple .
what you see here on this tough@@ ness graph is the higher the black dot is on the graph , the higher the tough@@ ness .
to bor@@ row from the writ@@ ings of a spider named char@@ lot@@ te , silk is terrific .
fli@@ ck@@ r is a photo@@ -@@ sharing service that allows people to take photos , up@@ load them , share them over the web and so forth .
you notice we haven &apos;t got everybody who has a photo .
and worst of all , that figure at the bottom , approximately ten photos per photographer , is a lie .
this is the math underlying the 80 / 20 rule . right ?
right ? so , when institutions are told they are obstacles , and that there are other ways of coordin@@ ating the value , they go through something a little bit like the ku@@ bl@@ er-@@ ross stages -- -- of reaction , being told you have a fat@@ al illness : denial , anger , bar@@ ga@@ ining , accep@@ tance .
the invent@@ ors don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states right now t@@ ying themselves into kno@@ ts , trying to figure out whether or not blog@@ gers are journalists .
it was produced by analy@@ zing their communications patterns using a lot of these tools . and doub@@ tless the intelligence communities of the world are doing the same work today for the attacks of last week .
so a ba@@ ker , and a good ba@@ ker , knows how to pull or draw forth the inher@@ ent sugar trapped in the star@@ ch .
that &apos;s the challenge . okay , so , now , what we -- in the journey of wheat , let &apos;s go back and look at these 12 stages .
this takes a second , but it &apos;s a distin@@ ctive stage .
and then we have stage 12 , which the textbooks call &quot; pack@@ aging , &quot; but my students call &quot; eating . &quot;
it &apos;s not only been killed , but it &apos;s been den@@ ied any potential for creating future life .
bacteria is in there , eating the same sug@@ ars , turning them into acids .
it &apos;s used as a symbol for transformation .
and i &apos;m not kid@@ ding , i just think we should just say that and move forward .
they &apos;re all moun@@ ted on my instruments .
it &apos;s a bunch of crazy pic@@ to@@ graphic no@@ tation .
let &apos;s watch just another clip .
i &apos;ve decided , ultimately , that this is the wrong question , that this is not the important question .
so half the time , she acted as if she liked the cr@@ ac@@ kers and didn &apos;t like the bro@@ c@@ coli -- just like a baby and any other sane person .
if we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us primates , but also including other mammals , birds , even mar@@ su@@ pi@@ als like kan@@ gar@@ o@@ os and wom@@ bats , it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are .
and at least until they &apos;re 23 , we &apos;re still po@@ pping those worms into those little open mou@@ ths .
then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
the first one is , again , remember , these are four year-olds .
oh .
and we even know something about the way the brain does this .
al@@ ison go@@ p@@ nik : what do babies think ?
now , the only way to get around that is to actually simul@@ ate the human body and to simul@@ ate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body .
those are then selected by the algorithm , re@@ produced with mutation and re@@ comb@@ inations to introduce sex as well .
now , this might look kind of trivial , but it &apos;s actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds .
and then , finally hits the floor .
so , they wanted to have a digital version of a stun@@ t@@ man and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been working on for the past few months .
at the moment , doing something like this by hand would take you probably a couple of days .
there &apos;s so many things we can do with this right now .
we do have one un@@ inten@@ tional dan@@ cer actually , the last thing i &apos;m going to show you .
it &apos;s a children &apos;s book for the i@@ pad .
i remember we cri@@ ed pro@@ fu@@ sely when the little go@@ ats we played with in the summer became bi@@ ri@@ an@@ i .
and my argument &#91; is &#93; that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspe@@ ctives at the earliest stage .
and you &apos;ll get paid for it . you can think about it , if you want .
which they do .
let &apos;s create a word processor that &apos;s just a word processor .
there are these &quot; wi@@ z@@ ards &quot; everywhere .
palm is also , especially in the old days , wonderful about this .
i write the code that fits the world today .
i made a fortune over at pi@@ x@@ ar .
in my very last example -- i do a lot of my work using speech recognition software , and you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous .
dp : thank you very much .
and the danger is that they can cause roughly what &apos;s a pandemic .
and i would say that we can &apos;t give up the rule of law to fight an asy@@ m@@ metric threat , which is what we seem to be doing because of the present , the people that are in power , because that &apos;s to give up the thing that makes civilization .
we &apos;ll hear a lot more about that from al gore very shortly .
it &apos;s a strange place inside a nan@@ ot@@ u@@ be .
we need new anti-@@ vir@@ als and cock@@ tails . we need new kinds of vaccines .
and finally , i think we have to do something that &apos;s not really -- it &apos;s almost un@@ acceptable to say this -- which , we have to begin to design the future .
i think it &apos;s time that we transi@@ tioned to a solar syste@@ m-@@ going civilization and species .
how hard is it going to be to find life on mars ?
i think it &apos;s there , and i think we need to go look for it , and i think it &apos;s underground .
it &apos;s a very simple trick , and i never fail to do it when i &apos;m sitting in a window seat .
in this cave , great areas are covered by this red@@ dish material that you see here , and also these enormous cryst@@ als of sel@@ en@@ ite that you can see dan@@ g@@ ling down .
in order to access these sub-@@ surface environments that we &apos;re interested in , we &apos;re very interested in developing the tools to do this .
so , we &apos;re talking about things like in@@ flat@@ able lin@@ ers that can con@@ form to the complex to@@ po@@ logical shape on the inside of a cave , fo@@ a@@ me@@ d-@@ in-@@ place air@@ lo@@ cks to deal with this complex to@@ po@@ logy , various ways of getting breathing gases made from the intrin@@ sic materials of these bodies .
but when you tell someone your goal and they ac@@ knowledge it , psychologists have found that it &apos;s called a &quot; social reality . &quot;
and so it is with archi@@ me@@ des , the great greek mathematician .
for@@ ger@@ ies were painted over it , and it suffered very badly from mo@@ ld .
and so before we could start imaging archi@@ me@@ des , we had to take this book apart .
and that &apos;s what it looks like .
but as the electrons go round at the speed of light , they shed x-@@ rays .
this was a bad idea , because philip of mac@@ e@@ don had a son called alexander the great , and they lost the battle of cha@@ er@@ one@@ a .
because institutions at the moment con@@ fine their data with copyright restri@@ ctions and that sort of thing .
how do you read a two-@@ thous@@ and@@ -year-old man@@ uscri@@ pt that has been er@@ ased , cut up , written on and painted over ? with a powerful particle acceler@@ ator , of course ! ancient books cur@@ ator william no@@ el tells the fascinating story behind the archi@@ me@@ des pal@@ imp@@ se@@ st , a by@@ z@@ ant@@ ine pra@@ yer book conta@@ ining previ@@ ous@@ ly-@@ unknown original writ@@ ings from ancient greek mathematician archi@@ me@@ des and others .
there are very few places in the u.s. where you can try real ko@@ be , and one of them is wol@@ f@@ gang p@@ uck &apos;s restaurant , cut , in los angeles .
they did give me a tour , though .
i did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other o@@ live o@@ ils .
and to try this -- i couldn &apos;t get a lo@@ an@@ er , but i did go into the manhattan sho@@ w@@ room of the manufac@@ tu@@ rer , to@@ to , and they have a bathroom off of the sho@@ w@@ room that you can use , which i used .
most of the cars that i drive , if i get up to 80 they start to rat@@ tle .
it was three days , four meals .
and in particular , i think we can learn things about learning .
it &apos;s from the game world of war@@ craft with more than 10 million players globally , one of whom is me , another of whom is my wife .
now , if you take a game like war@@ craft , you can think about it , if you like , as a great bo@@ x-@@ opening effort .
no , we want one or two mon@@ sters on the screen at any one time .
second , multiple long and short-@@ term aims -- 5,000 p@@ ies , boring , 15 p@@ ies , interesting .
and what this means is we can predict learning , we can predict enhan@@ ced engagement , these windows , these windows of time , in which the learning is taking place at an enhan@@ ced level .
let &apos;s start with business .
and through this work , i hope to better understand the evolutionary vulner@@ abilities of our bodies , so that we can improve and better manage our health in the future .
and so previous studies had only focused on micro@@ scop@@ y .
so i took a job at the united nations world food program@@ me as a way to try to address these security issues through food security issues .
unfortunately , obesity &apos;s not only an american problem .
there &apos;s this large , con@@ soli@@ dated farming that &apos;s led to what we eat in america , and it &apos;s really been since around 19@@ 80 , after the oil crisis , when , you know , mass con@@ soli@@ dation , mass ex@@ od@@ us of small farmers in this country .
the ic@@ ons like michael pol@@ lan and jam@@ ie o@@ liver in his ted prize wish both addre@@ ssed this last three-@@ decade time period as incredibly relevant for food system change .
this is a construction hel@@ met that i received two years ago at the gr@@ ound@@ breaking of the largest project i , and my firm , have ever been involved in .
but i &apos;m going to reduce this to the beginning of the process , into three very pe@@ dan@@ tic state@@ ments .
if we are so good at our craft shouldn &apos;t we be able to concei@@ ve of an architectural manife@@ station that slides se@@ am@@ lessly through the project &apos;s and the client &apos;s constraints ?
the architectural manife@@ station was frankly just dumb .
you &apos;re going down into our lo@@ bby , go through the lo@@ bby with our own little dan@@ gly bits , whether you like them or not , up through the sta@@ ir that leads you into the aud@@ it@@ orium .
and the solution in terms of the bal@@ con@@ ies was to use something that we all know as a sco@@ re@@ board lift .
this building has the ability , in short order , to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can rent it out .
and to remind you that here is an example in which architecture actually did something .
and i really loved this idea of the parti@@ al glimpse into somebody &apos;s life .
&quot; i love how they were able to preserve most in everything that makes you feel close to nature -- butter@@ flies , man@@ -@@ made forests , li@@ me@@ stone caves and hey , even a huge py@@ th@@ on . &quot;
so these are some ne@@ wer projects that actually aren &apos;t even launched public@@ ly yet .
we &apos;re very used to this .
this graph that i &apos;m cli@@ cking down here is meant to be remin@@ is@@ cent of a medical heart@@ beat graph , showing the exciting moments of ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine .
so , you have some really happy person holding 10 ballo@@ ons , and some really sad soul holding one balloon .
he had this amazing series of ha@@ irs growing out of a mo@@ le on the left side of his face , which i &apos;m told is very good luck .
one of the more tou@@ ch@@ y political subjects in b@@ hu@@ tan is the use of indian cheap labor that they im@@ port from india to build the roads , and then they send these people home once the roads are built .
but i prefer for maybe 40 to 50 .
and you never think you &apos;re going to be the guy who &apos;s walking down the street and , because you choose to go down one side or the other , the rest of your life is changed forever .
and — — the nurse kind of had a hy@@ steri@@ cal laugh , and i &apos;m turning my head trying to see everybody , and i had this weird memory of being in college and raising , raising money for the floo@@ d victims of bangladesh , and then i look over and my anesthe@@ si@@ ologist is cla@@ mping the mask on me , and i think , &quot; he looks bangla@@ de@@ shi , &quot; — — and i just have those two facts , and i just think , &quot; this could work somehow . &quot;
ed ga@@ vag@@ an : a story about kno@@ ts and surgeons
now of course , as history has gone by , it &apos;s been natural for there to be a certain amount of ble@@ ed between speech and writing .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing in this finger@@ ed speech .
if you listen to the way black youth today speak , think about the use of the word &quot; yo . &quot;
&quot; many do not know the alphabet or multipli@@ cation table , cannot write gra@@ m@@ matically -- &quot; we &apos;ve heard that sort of thing before , not just in 195@@ 6 . 19@@ 17 , connec@@ ti@@ cut school@@ teacher .
and then the third thing would be , please show me a sh@@ ea@@ f of texts written by 16@@ -year-old girls , because i would want to know where this language had developed since our times , and ide@@ ally i would then send them back to you and me now so we could exam@@ ine this lingu@@ istic miracle happening right under our no@@ ses .
gol@@ an lev@@ in : software art
it is extremely unlikely the taliban would ever be able to take over the country -- extremely unlikely they &apos;d be able to se@@ ize k@@ ab@@ ul .
and the same is true for the troops .
and yet , nobody listened to them .
very , very sadly , our foreign services , the united nations , the military in these countries have very little idea of what &apos;s going on .
but you need to look at context .
it makes failure invisible , in@@ concei@@ vable and inevitable .
the problem that i want to talk with you about is really the problem of : how does one supply healthcare in a world in which cost is everything ?
that &apos;s what a hydro@@ phi@@ lic surface does .
those half of you , roughly , who are women , at some point may have had a pregn@@ ancy test .
there is a very important issue here , which is that because it &apos;s a printer , a color printer , it prints colors . that &apos;s what color pr@@ inter@@ s do .
so , you take the drop of blood , no further manipu@@ lations , you put it on a little device , the device fil@@ ters out the blood cells , lets the ser@@ um go through , and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there .
and , of course the answer is , &quot; you don &apos;t . &quot;
and we sent it off , and by return mail it came back .
traditional lab tests for disease diagnosis can be too expensive and cu@@ mb@@ er@@ some for the regions most in need . george wh@@ ite@@ sides &apos; in@@ geni@@ ous answer is a fo@@ ol@@ proof tool that can be manufac@@ tured at virtually zero cost . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and we think people like this probably don &apos;t want to vote for people who look like this and are named bar@@ ack obama .
and so we can look at a bunch of different vari@@ ables .
but you see democr@@ ats versus republi@@ can , not a big difference based on who your neighbors are .
and you interact a lot with your neighbors -- people you like , people you might not know .
i &apos;m a physician practicing with cu@@ tt@@ ing-@@ edge technology .
he says , &quot; you see , when she said , &apos; good morning , &apos; i picked up her fi@@ fe ac@@ cent .
so within a few years , in the late 18@@ 0@@ 0s , early 190@@ 0s , all of a sudden , the bar@@ ber surgeon had given way to the physician who was trying to make a diagnosis .
there &apos;s a real dis@@ jun@@ ction between the patient &apos;s perception and our own per@@ ceptions as physicians of the best medical care .
and to her , that spoke of a kind of att@@ enti@@ veness that she needed .
the good news , it &apos;s not cancer , it &apos;s not tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , it &apos;s not co@@ c@@ ci@@ di@@ o@@ id@@ om@@ y@@ co@@ sis or some ob@@ sc@@ ure fung@@ al infection .
i would per@@ cu@@ ss the chest . i would listen to the heart .
modern medicine is in danger of losing a powerful , old-@@ fashi@@ oned tool : human touch . physician and writer abraham ver@@ gh@@ ese describes our strange new world where patients are merely data points , and calls for a return to the traditional one-@@ on-@@ one physical ex@@ am .
and the answer is , if you open enough of them , yes .
and in all cases we have to ask -- what &apos;s the more likely explanation ?
in the case of g@@ ali@@ leo , he had two problems when he turned his telescope to saturn .
faces of all kinds are easy to see .
i guess you can only have one miracle per building .
it was in the top five in 2005 , called , &quot; nine million bicy@@ cles in beijing . &quot;
heart and blood vessel diseases still kill more people -- not only in this country , but also worldwide -- than everything else combined , and yet it &apos;s completely prev@@ ent@@ able for almost everybody .
imagine : many of these problems could be preven@@ ted if these babies were just kept warm .
over the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies .
but what do we do for a living ?
and then he went to north carolina and did it again .
and you can build an entire industry on that .
and people in white ha@@ ts sa@@ iling boats .
so some people will go out and get people to be on one team .
someone stands up and says , &quot; this one is important .
&quot; what would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes i gave exactly the same pair to someone who doesn &apos;t even own a pair of shoes ? &quot;
being a leader gives you char@@ is@@ ma .
the sensor would have to be in@@ expensive , rapid , simple , sensitive , selec@@ tive , and minim@@ ally inva@@ sive .
you start with some water , pour in some nan@@ ot@@ u@@ bes , add anti@@ bodies , mix it up , take some paper , di@@ p it , dry it , and you can detect cancer .
and so in the next two to five years , this sensor could potentially lift for pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer survival rates from a dis@@ mal 5@@ .@@ 5 percent to close to 100 percent , and it would do similar for o@@ vari@@ an and lung cancer .
my experience , however , in the islamic world is very different .
so , for example , there is the character of no@@ ora .
and why does sex make babies , and babies spell ero@@ tic disaster in cou@@ ples ?
what is the relationship between love and desire ?
and in this space between me and the other lies the ero@@ tic é@@ lan , lies that movement toward the other .
is it a place where you can express your inf@@ anti@@ le wishes ?
it won &apos;t make a dent . there is nobody at the re@@ ception desk .
child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoulder all the time .
it &apos;s focus and presence .
we managed , but sometimes those h@@ alls didn &apos;t seem exactly su@@ ited to the music i was making or had made .
they &apos;re smaller , even less rever@@ ber@@ ant , so he can write really fri@@ l@@ ly music that &apos;s very intri@@ cate -- and it works .
it meant that there could be extreme dynamics , which there weren &apos;t in some of these other kinds of music .
other sin@@ gers after him went even further .
and in some ways , the music that they &apos;re writing for this place works perfectly .
and i thought : well , if this is a model for creation , if we make music , primarily the form at least , to fit these contex@@ ts , and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls , and if we write software to fit existing operating systems , is that how it works ?
and had such -- it was an ey@@ e-@@ opening experience to hear them talk about the world that is yet to come through technology and science .
but this is not the first time that we &apos;ve had a technological revolution .
and yet he says , &quot; he re@@ stores my soul . &quot;
you &apos;ve seen people take benef@@ icial technological advances , such as the internet we &apos;ve heard about tonight , and tw@@ ist them into something corru@@ p@@ ting .
and i knew mr. do@@ br@@ yn@@ in very well , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to sit be@@ side mr@@ s. gor@@ bac@@ he@@ v tonight .
un@@ be@@ ar@@ able psychological pres@@ sures bear down on us .
it &apos;s difficult for them to understand that they &apos;re going to die .
i &apos;ve done a lot of speaking in germany and in france , and in different parts of the world -- 10@@ 5 countries it &apos;s been my privilege to speak in .
essentially , he said this : &quot; if you bet on god , and open yourself to his love , you lose nothing , even if you &apos;re wrong .
i couldn &apos;t take it to a laboratory and experiment with it .

the women &apos;s chief of the village has this little girl , fair color like me , totally dirty .

i want to look back 20 years from now and see that there &apos;s another lib@@ erian girl , gh@@ an@@ ai@@ an girl , nigerian girl , ethiop@@ ian girl standing on this ted stage .

li@@ ck@@ li@@ der fore@@ saw computers doing all the rou@@ tin@@ iz@@ able work that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision making .
every interaction we have in the world is recorded by an ever growing array of sensors : your phone , your credit card , your computer . the result is big data , and it actually presents us with an opportunity to more deeply understand the human condition .
these foreign figh@@ ters had left their families in the gulf , the lev@@ ant and north africa to join al qaeda in iraq .
the human goal here was to identify camps for re@@ location based on priority need .
and the reality of the society that we &apos;re in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet , scre@@ aming desper@@ ation , where they work long , hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don &apos;t need to im@@ press people they don &apos;t like .
play a sport with a friend at lun@@ ch@@ time .
now i don &apos;t mean to mo@@ ck , but being a fit 10-@@ h@@ our@@ -@@ a-@@ day office rat isn &apos;t more bal@@ anced ; it &apos;s more fit .
and that , i think , is an idea worth spreading .
as a black person in america , i am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health .
so how did things get so different for us ?
who profits ? does anything justi@@ fy what the local community goes through ?
and they provide habit@@ ats for our little friends !
and we are operating with a comprehen@@ sive urban planning defic@@ it .
for his brilliant efforts , he was nearly im@@ pe@@ ached .
of the 90 percent of the energy that mr. gore reminded us that we waste every day , don &apos;t add wa@@ sting our energy , intelligence and hard-@@ ear@@ ned experience to that count .
she wrote back to me and she said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud to have a son that created the software that allowed these kids to make mother &apos;s day cards for their mothers . &quot;
it seems that everybody is getting into the act .
and as i move my hand , i can pop the ballo@@ ons or i can move the bug .
so i showed him .
again , it &apos;s useful to think about this analogy with language .
this is completely different than autom@@ ob@@ iles .
i want to talk about this .
we &apos;re interested in finding beauty that &apos;s more than just an aesthetic ; it &apos;s really a truth .
all right ? now one thing about art is , art is discovery , and art is discovering yourself through your art . right ?
hopefully , really understand the customer at its heart , where the customer is , live with them in america . so -- sent the team off , and actually something different happened . they went other places .
the engineers flew over , and designers got together with them , and they put their presentation together .
that &apos;s what you get fu@@ ri@@ ous about right ?
chris ban@@ gle : great cars are great art
now as i was training in clinical medicine and he@@ mat@@ ology and on@@ co@@ logy and stem cell trans@@ plan@@ tation , what we had instead , ca@@ sca@@ ding through the regul@@ atory network at the f@@ da , were these sub@@ stances -- ar@@ sen@@ ic , th@@ ali@@ dom@@ ide and this chemical deri@@ va@@ tive of nitrogen mu@@ star@@ d gas .
in effect , the cancer cell was for@@ getting it was cancer and becoming a normal cell .
and this was , unfortunately , successful .
the first is if anything is unique about this research , it &apos;s less the science than the strategy -- that this for us was a social experiment , an experiment in what would happen if we were as open and honest at the earliest phase of discovery chemistry research as we could be .
one thing you can do with a picture like this is simply admi@@ re it .
because if there had been , they would have collapsed under the gravit@@ ational pull into a huge black hole .
that &apos;s our job as cosmo@@ logists .
and this energy , according to einstein , ex@@ er@@ ts a push on the universe .
that impli@@ cation was studied by bol@@ t@@ z@@ mann back in the 19th century .
that &apos;s the region where entropy is low .
but we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more .
or maybe the big bang is not the beginning of the universe .
i had never seen an internet .
i felt very happy to be at the secon@@ dary school , so i was determined to do anything possible to receive education .
god b@@ less .
so , here , whatever movement i do in my physical world is actually repli@@ cated inside the digital world just using this small device that i made , around eight years back , in 2000 .
i took it very literally , and took my bike hel@@ met , put a little cut over there so that the proje@@ ctor actually fits nic@@ ely .
the camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements , but , interestingly , is also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand .
and why only computers ? we can just play with papers .
pm : there is a lot of energy here . lots of learning .
actually it was a very hard challenge .
if you don &apos;t have open spaces , you &apos;ve got to go there and open spaces .
you can build nice stations .
the first one is , you can change from what i call a &#91; v@@ icious &#93; circle to a virtual circle .
you can imagine how people get happy with me watching these kinds of scenes .
i &apos;ll get to you now the inci@@ dents of the day .
that is great , that means we &apos;re going to have 10 billion minds working together , 10 billion talents together .
in@@ ca sculp@@ tures are regar@@ ded as tre@@ a@@ sures in british muse@@ ums , while shakespeare is translated into every major language of the earth .
darwin himself , by the way , had no doub@@ ts that the peac@@ o@@ ck &apos;s tail was beautiful in the eyes of the pe@@ ah@@ en .
beautiful shell ne@@ ck@@ l@@ ac@@ es that look like something you &apos;d see at an arts and cra@@ fts fair , as well as o@@ ch@@ re body paint , have been found from around 100,000 years ago .
yes , ha@@ ir@@ sty@@ ling -- i insi@@ st on that .
we have already an autonomous vehicle .
the system is also smart enough to figure out the safe@@ st way to operate the car .
so it &apos;s actually a multi-@@ dimensional user interface .
you must be out of your mind . &quot;
i was leaving a se@@ min@@ ar when it started , hum@@ ming to myself , fu@@ mbling with my bag just as i &apos;d done a hundred times before , when suddenly i heard a voice cal@@ m@@ ly observe , &quot; she is leaving the room . &quot;
it was at this point that events began to rapidly over@@ take me .
i used to say that these people saved me , but what i now know is they did something even more important in that they empowered me to save myself , and cru@@ cially , they helped me to understand something which i &apos;d always suspe@@ cted : that my voices were a meaningful response to trau@@ matic life events , particularly childhood events , and as such were not my enemies but a source of insight into sol@@ vable emotional problems .
to para@@ phrase cha@@ ve@@ z , once social change begins , it cannot be rever@@ sed .
what they remember is , of course , the great tri@@ u@@ mph , that the br@@ its were beaten , and we won , and that the country was born .
and that makes it extraordinarily interesting as a place to explore .
but better -- what is more important is that they would have to concentrate sunlight .
you see the red g@@ low in their eyes , which is the reflection of the fla@@ sh@@ light .
they look like , maybe like sun@@ flowers .
i was a teenager , and at 15 or 16 , i guess like all teenagers , we want to just do what we love and what we believe in .
and that allows me to check my tim@@ er dis@@ cre@@ tely , here , without ben@@ ding my el@@ bow .
i mean , think about it : the care we take in selec@@ ting sun@@ glasses , or jewel@@ ry , or acces@@ sor@@ ies is really important , so if it isn &apos;t beautiful , it really doesn &apos;t belong on your face .
so we called it y water . and so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room : the three-dimensional design , the ideas , the br@@ anding , it all becomes deeply connected .
in fact , you can see each logo is a little bit different .
and if anybody asks why you &apos;re carrying a con@@ dom , you can just say you like the design .
the first half will be performed by the live sin@@ gers here on stage .
and what , if anything , do men have to do with it ?
my father , who had fought in three wars , could not save his own sister from this suffering .
&quot; he was flat@@ tered .
i see traditional music like a kind of re@@ bel@@ lion , in which people can really speak their voice , especially traditional songs from other parts of the former yu@@ go@@ sla@@ v republic .
but no , for the prote@@ st , they dressed all in white , no ma@@ ke@@ up .
women like sa@@ ken@@ a and lea@@ h and lay@@ ma have hu@@ mbled me and changed me and made me realize that i should not be so quick to jump to assumptions of any kind .
we can de@@ mil@@ it@@ ar@@ ize societies and pour resources , instead , into reser@@ vo@@ irs of genu@@ ine security .
and i thought , &quot; well , sir , i am not a strate@@ gi@@ st , nor am i speci@@ alist . i am merely a storyteller . &quot;
so what could this mean ?
they were together while pra@@ ying .
and there are two important messages , or two lessons , to take from that reality .
and the religious police im@@ poses the supposed islamic way of life on every citizen , by force -- like women are forced to cover their heads -- wear the hi@@ ja@@ b , the islamic head cover .
it &apos;s our faith , and we will be loy@@ al to it .
and this is a question , i think , which needs to be discus@@ sed carefully .
that &apos;s an experience that not every other muslim nation in the middle east had until very recently .
mu@@ staf@@ a ak@@ yo@@ l : faith versus tradition in islam
it clear@@ s the forest , reveals the trees inside .
and anti@@ body sta@@ in@@ ings like this one can be used to understand that sort of question .
dar@@ fur may have sli@@ pped from the news headlines , but the killing and dis@@ plac@@ ement there continues as well , and the she@@ er human miser@@ y that it creates is very hard to fa@@ tho@@ m .
thus , even though every civi@@ lian killed , ma@@ imed , raped , or tor@@ tured is one too many , the fact that the number of civi@@ lian ca@@ su@@ al@@ ties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago , is good news .
but then , is northern ireland a unique example , or does this kind of explanation only hold more generally in democratic and developed countries ?
both success@@ es and failures teach us several cri@@ tically important things that we need to bear in mind if we want the good news to continue .
as a photographer for national geographic , i &apos;ve portra@@ yed it for many .
mud and min@@ erals become sub@@ str@@ ate ; there are bacteria .
on land , life turned a corner . ja@@ ws formed first ; teeth came later .
extinction can come slowly , but sometimes it arri@@ ves fast .
and where it doesn &apos;t , as in greenland in winter , mars is still not very far .
so in australia , &quot; mo &quot; is s@@ lan@@ g for mu@@ stac@@ he , so we ren@@ amed the month of november &quot; mo@@ vember &quot; and created some pretty basic rules , which still stand today .
and we persi@@ sted , and we got 4@@ 50 guys growing mu@@ st@@ aches , and together we raised 5@@ 4,000 dollars , and we don@@ ated every cent of that to the prostate cancer foundation of australia , and that represented at the time the single biggest don@@ ation they &apos;d ever received .
so what we did was , we took some of the money that we raised in australia to bring the campaign across to this country , the u.s , and the u.k. , and we did that because we knew , if this was successful , we could raise infin@@ itely more money globally than we could just in australia . and that money fuels research , and that research will get us to a cure .
so we p@@ iled into a tax@@ i , and this is our tax@@ i driver , and i was sitting in the back seat , and he turned around and said , &quot; where are you going ? &quot;
and so we said , right , we &apos;d re@@ defined charity . we need to re@@ define the way these guys operate . how do we do that ?
he could see what was happening to his forest , to his environment , because he was taken under his grandfather &apos;s wing when he was only two years old to begin to learn about the forest and the way of life of his people .
he would tell you , as he told me , &quot; i asked myself , &quot; he said , &quot; what did my grandparents and my great-@@ grandparents do to protect the forest for me ?
we have to change .
even that wasn &apos;t enough .
he would tell you , &quot; i &apos;m a collec@@ tor , and i cur@@ ate a museum . &quot;
they have a sense of the great ar@@ c of time and their tiny place in it .
he went around once , he went around twice , he went around thri@@ ce .
on the banks of a river called the indus , now in pakistan .
you should not be si@@ sy@@ ph@@ us , who ro@@ lls a rock up a mountain all day only to find the bou@@ l@@ der rolled down at night .
you see , the indians also had a river that separ@@ ates the land of the living from the land of the dead .
the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator of the gy@@ m@@ no@@ sophi@@ st &apos;s life was infin@@ ity .
there is no orchestra conductor .
and i would see the ex@@ as@@ per@@ ation between my american and european colleagues , when they were dealing with india .
so , there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life .
and so the next time you meet someone , a stran@@ ger , one request : understand that you live in the subje@@ ctive truth , and so does he .
you &apos;re afraid if you look for your passion and don &apos;t find it , you &apos;ll feel like you &apos;re an idi@@ ot , so then you make exc@@ uses about why you &apos;re not going to look for your passion .
you know what ? here &apos;s a little secret .
you need 20 interests , and then one of them , one of them might grab you , one of them might engage you more than anything else , and then you may have found your greatest love in comparison to all the other things that interest you , and that &apos;s what passion is .
what do you want me to say ?
&quot; look kid . i had a dream once , too , but -- but . &quot;
and that &apos;s why you &apos;re not going to have a great career , unless -- unless , that most ev@@ o@@ ca@@ tive of all english words -- unless .
you may recall a year ago when a fire@@ storm er@@ up@@ ted after the united states preven@@ tive services task force re@@ viewed the world &apos;s mammo@@ graphy scre@@ ening literature and issu@@ ed a gu@@ ide@@ line recomm@@ ending against scre@@ ening mammo@@ grams in women in their 4@@ 0s .
so it &apos;s easy to see this tumor in the upper part of this fat@@ ty breast .
and sooner or later , we &apos;re going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation can &apos;t always come at a much higher price .
so here we were , a nuclear physicist , an inter@@ ni@@ st , soon joined by carri@@ e h@@ rus@@ ka , a bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal engineer , and two radi@@ ologists , and we were trying to take on the en@@ tr@@ en@@ ched world of mammo@@ graphy with a machine that was held together by duc@@ t tape .
here &apos;s an example from that scre@@ ening study .
we still need to complete the scre@@ ening study using the low dose , and then our findings will need to be repli@@ cated at other institutions , and this could take five or more years .
the babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question are now both in middle school , and the answer has been so slow to come .
i can look at your financial records .
or should we respect his privacy , protect his dignity and leave him alone ?
what &apos;s a moral operating system ?
i &apos;m just going back and forth ; i &apos;m not getting anywhere .
if you think that way , you have a plat@@ on@@ ist moral framework .
not just because it ran@@ g earlier , but i &apos;m going to take it because i made a little calcu@@ lation .
what &apos;s the formula ?
or like k@@ ant , did i use reason to figure out what was intrin@@ sically right ? &quot;
du@@ m ta da da du@@ m du@@ m ta da da du@@ m well , your musician friend will stop you and say , &quot; you know , the theme music for your data revolution , that &apos;s an opera , that &apos;s w@@ ag@@ ner .
it &apos;s our invisible reality .
and this noise is the most neutral .
definitely not perfect . so you would probably shut it , at this point .
you have to know that today , roughly one or two every drug pills is not taken correctly .
i designed it to help kids to follow the treatment .
so , huge tragedy .
because the roots of the plant are not very effective .
now we can eat local food .
so , if you believe the media accounts , being a drug deal@@ er in the height of the crack cocaine epidemic was a very glamorous life , in the words of virginia pos@@ tre@@ l .
and in the words of mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well , crack cocaine was the extra@@ -@@ ch@@ un@@ ky version of tom@@ a@@ to sauce for the inner city .
he was really a curious sight to be seen .
went up to the floor , the second floor , and said : &quot; hey , guys .
now , the group i really want you to think about , though , are the ones at the bottom , the foot soldiers .
we found in our gang -- and , ad@@ mit@@ tedly , this was not really sort of a standard situation ; this was a time of intense violence -- of a lot of gang wars -- as this gang actually became quite successful . but there were costs .
but what happened was , the rules changed , and they never got to make partner .
and the words of a gang member capture it quite nic@@ ely .
from there i started with sky@@ diving .
2005 i did a base jump from the ei@@ ger , from the mon@@ k and from the jun@@ g@@ fra@@ u , three very famous mountains in switzerland .
i know the answer to this , but how do you land ?
and do you ever say , &quot; no , no i &apos;m not going to . &quot;
i think there is a soci@@ alizing dimension in , kind of , moving that border .
is art about that ?
so the movement with your legs will change the color of your horizon .
and &quot; ha@@ -@@ ha , there is a picture and here is i@@ . and what does it matter ? &quot;
in the spectacular large-scale projects he &apos;s famous for , o@@ la@@ fur eli@@ as@@ son creates art from a pal@@ et@@ te of space , distance , color and light . this ide@@ a-@@ packed talk begins with an experiment in the nature of perception .
i think that &apos;s got to be sc@@ aring a lot of animals away .
we need a na@@ sa@@ -like organization for ocean exploration , because we need to be exploring and protecting our life support systems here on earth .
when she was 10 years old in 19@@ 27 , she published her first book of poems called &quot; the jan@@ it@@ or &apos;s boy . &quot;
and my blood fro@@ ze when i read that because i had written the pla@@ in-@@ song music 1@@ 30 years after he &apos;d written the letter .
nat@@ ali@@ e mer@@ ch@@ ant sin@@ gs from her new albu@@ m , &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; leave your sleep . &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; ly@@ ri@@ cs from near@@ -@@ forgotten 19@@ th-@@ century poetry pair with her un@@ mista@@ kable voice for a performance that brought the audience to its feet .
they are very different from us in body form .
so as an adult , when i started to read about the amazing break@@ through@@ s with pen@@ ny patter@@ son and k@@ ok@@ o , with sue sa@@ va@@ ge-@@ ru@@ mb@@ au@@ gh and kan@@ zi , pan@@ ban@@ i@@ sha , ir@@ en@@ e pep@@ per@@ berg , alex the par@@ rot , i got all excited .
this is what the internet looked like when it was born and you can call that the internet of middle-@@ aged white men , mostly middle-@@ aged white men .
jo@@ ining me are three of our eight atlantic bot@@ t@@ len@@ ose dolphins : 20@@ -year-old che@@ sa@@ pe@@ a@@ ke , who was our first dolphin born here , her four@@ -year-old daughter ba@@ y@@ ley , and her half sister , 11@@ -year-old may@@ a .
that &apos;s a number only that congress can appreciate .
what that means is that what we &apos;re learning with these interactions with other species will teach us , ultimately , how we might interact with an alien from another world .
all right , well thank you all so much for jo@@ ining us .
and now people from iran are talking to me .
they have graphic designers . what ?
and this whole list of pages on facebook dedicated to the same message , to people sending their love , one to each other .
remember that image from the beginning ?
and i &apos;m just going to take a picture of it , and i &apos;m just going to post it on facebook with kind of &quot; israel@@ is for peace &quot; or something .
as you can see , a project evol@@ ves through a series of generations of design meetings .
but then we had a meeting with a chinese business@@ man who saw our design and said , &quot; wow , that &apos;s the chinese character for the word &apos; people . &apos; &quot; so , apparently this is how you write &quot; people , &quot; as in the people &apos;s republic of china .
china symbo@@ lized by the dra@@ gon .
you can try it .
if you do come to copenhagen , you will probably see an installation by ai wei@@ we@@ i , the chinese artist .
so if you go back into the parking , into the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ors , it &apos;s almost like traveling into a parallel universe from cars and colors , into this sort of sou@@ th-@@ facing urban o@@ as@@ is .
and our main idea was to sort of sample the seven most significant mountains of the to@@ po@@ graphy of a@@ zer@@ ba@@ ij@@ an and re@@ interpret them into urban and architectural structures , in@@ habit@@ able of human life .
and i must say , before i go on , i should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because i &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
because we can &apos;t solve problems .
so what i &apos;m propos@@ ing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we &apos;ve had a men@@ u of choices .
and then you ask , why economists ?
but it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
the inci@@ dence of malaria is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get infected every year .
so again , what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment , at first rate .
of course , that &apos;s mainly because climate change has good pictures .
the only two requi@@ rements were that they were studying at the university , and they spoke english .
over the past hundred years , the combination of liberal democracy and private capitalism has helped to cata@@ pul@@ t the united states and western countries to new levels of economic development .
i put it to you today that it is this system that is embo@@ died by china that is gathering momentum amongst people in the emerging markets as the system to follow , because they believe increasingly that it is the system that will promise the best and fastest improvements in living standards in the shor@@ test period of time .
i &apos;m here to also tell you that there are lots of shifts occurring around what china is doing in the democratic stance .
but i put it to you that if the united states and european countries want to remain globally influ@@ ential , they may have to consider co@@ operating in the short term in order to compete , and by that , they might have to focus more aggre@@ ssively on economic outcomes to help create the middle class and therefore be able to hold government accoun@@ table and create the democr@@ acies that we really want .
in this ve@@ in , we can increase economic growth .
that if you live in the best climate , in san di@@ ego in the united states , or in the sh@@ it@@ ti@@ est climate , in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york , you are going to be just as happy in either place .
and so even if we make those very important decisions for very silly reasons , it remains statisti@@ cally true that there are more ge@@ org@@ es living in geor@@ gia and there are more den@@ n@@ ises becoming denti@@ sts and there are more paul@@ as who are married to paul than statisti@@ cally vi@@ able .
and i of course knew stuff , as a designer , about ty@@ po@@ graphy , even though we worked with those animals not so successfully .
after about three days , the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid .
and using indi@@ go , make it anti-@@ microbial .
su@@ z@@ ann@@ e , just a curiosity , what you &apos;re wearing is not random .
ba@@ o y@@ ong@@ xi@@ u : &quot; my mother tells me to come home and get married , but if i marry now , before i have fully developed myself , i can only marry an ordinary worker , so i &apos;m not in a rush . &quot;
many articles calculate : how long would it take for this worker to work in order to earn enough money to buy what he &apos;s making ?
another time , after min had already left the hand@@ bag factory , her younger sister came to visit , bringing two coach signature hand@@ bags as gi@@ fts .
thank you .
in 2009 , there were 500 bomb bla@@ sts across pakistan .
step two : they teach the children the koran , which is islam &apos;s holi@@ est book , in arabic , a language these children do not understand and cannot speak .
this boy is called me@@ ss@@ ou@@ d .
we &apos;ve flo@@ wn the cas@@ sin@@ i spacecraft by this moon now several times , flying closer and deeper into these je@@ ts , into the den@@ ser regions of these je@@ ts , so that now we have come away with some very precise com@@ posi@@ tional measurements .
we &apos;re always sort of small in the face of its expan@@ se .
and that connection is an une@@ qui@@ vo@@ cally physical process .
they looked for the un@@ wired places , and that &apos;s meant north and south , primarily these cables to africa .
thank you .
and this material that &apos;s depos@@ ited either starts as a liquid form or a material pow@@ der form .
the detail that you can get today is quite amazing .
but it &apos;s very hard to create that in standard ways .
you can just make it physically on the spot .
we &apos;re now , instead of shi@@ pping a product across the world , we &apos;re sending data across the internet .
businesses want different things .
but it wasn &apos;t just us . even in the muslim world , his definition of jihad began to gain accep@@ tance .
what does that mean for us in the west ?
but that &apos;s still not reason for us to di@@ sen@@ g@@ age , because we &apos;ve seen that movie before , in afghanistan .
al ja@@ ze@@ era brought information to them , showed them what was being said and done in the name of their religion , exposed the hypo@@ cri@@ sy of osa@@ ma bin laden and al qaeda , and allowed them , gave them the information that allowed them to come to their own conclu@@ sions .
thank you .
i was struck immediately by the kindness and the gent@@ l@@ eness in her face , and i asked her to tell me her story .
she lives with all of that in@@ security , and in fact , in january , during the ethnic ri@@ ots , she was cha@@ sed from her home and had to find a new sha@@ ck in which she would live .
i truly believe it &apos;s where dignity starts .
by the way , the secret is not to go to sleep until you &apos;ve written your words for the day .
i had just taken tri@@ gon@@ ome@@ try in high school , i learned about the par@@ ab@@ ol@@ a and how it could concentrate rays of light to a single focus .
i &apos;m glad you heard earlier today , batteries are unbeliev@@ ably energy -- lack of density compared to fuel .
you take a problem that you can &apos;t solve with a pure mathematical answer , you build an evolutionary system to try multiple tries at guess@@ ing , you add sex -- where you take half of one solution and half of another and then make new mutations -- and you use natural selection to kill off not as good solutions .
so what you see here is 12 separate pe@@ tals , that each could be controlled with individual micro@@ pro@@ ces@@ sors that would only cost a dollar .
so , once you have mobility , now you &apos;re making a lot of engines because you &apos;ve got lots of units , as opposed to steam ships or big factories where you &apos;re not making as many units , so this was the engine that ended up benef@@ iting from mass production where all the other engines didn &apos;t benefit .
you move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you &apos;re only shifting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end , down to the hot end and up to the cold end .
so now you put the two things together .
so this is the first test where we took it outside and each of the pe@@ tals were individu@@ ally seeking .
it &apos;s just unbelievable what the potential is to take advantage of solar energy there , and i &apos;m really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that .
bill gross : a solar energy system that tracks the sun
but still , we look at the pieces .
and out of that field campaign we &apos;ll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules .
and that was a good thing to help , you know , the cause .
so , good things come out of , you know , in@@ comprehen@@ sion -- -- which i will do a painting of , and then it will end up in my work .
i work for the new yor@@ ker , and i do covers , and 9 / 11 happened and it was , you know , a complete and u@@ tter end of the world as we knew it .
and &quot; would &quot; is co@@ co chan@@ el &apos;s lo@@ ver , &quot; should &quot; is ed@@ ith sit@@ well , and &quot; could &quot; is an august san@@ der subject .
and then , we don &apos;t have a stu@@ ff@@ ed spin@@ o@@ za , but we do have a stu@@ ff@@ ed pa@@ v@@ lo@@ v &apos;s dog , and i visited him in the museum of hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e in st. pe@@ ter@@ s@@ burg , in russia .
i received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaper and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead .
so -- and that &apos;s a song about how everybody &apos;s miserable because , you know , we &apos;re from russia .
ma@@ ir@@ a k@@ al@@ man : the illustr@@ ated woman
but nevertheless , there &apos;s no real sense of separation from me in my heart , in terms of the love that i feel for these people .
so , as we are climbing the tree , some of the things that we &apos;re doing in order to climb the tree are actually under@@ mining the tree &apos;s very root .
they &apos;ll be cooking , cleaning , buying things , shopping , building . but they aren &apos;t here .
we were hoping that it was@@ s going to have a kind of evil , spi@@ der@@ y walk , but instead it created this pretty la@@ me way of moving forward .
kat@@ r@@ ina showed us that we cannot completely depend on government to have read@@ iness in hand , to be capable of hand@@ ling things .
for example , all mas@@ ks are made in china .
add on pandemic threat , you &apos;re in big trouble .
let &apos;s see , should we order that all pets be kept in@@ doors ?
in the s@@ ars epidemic , we learned in hong kong that most of transmission was because people were re@@ moving their mas@@ ks impro@@ per@@ ly .
every city , county , state did their own thing .
the institute of medicine study felt that you could not re@@ cycle mas@@ ks .
clearly the bottom line is the virus eventually atten@@ u@@ ates , and ce@@ ases to be a lethal virus to humanity , and finds other ho@@ sts .
in terms of where we are in science with dna identi@@ fication capac@@ ities and so on , it &apos;s not that far off .
we &apos;ve never seen anything even remot@@ ely like this before . &quot;
it &apos;s really man@@ eu@@ ver@@ able . you have a hand-@@ held remote , so you can pretty easily control acceler@@ ation , bra@@ king , go in reverse if you like , also have bra@@ king .
okay , i che@@ ated , it was a mere 20 seconds .
but in america you have to explain . what are clubs ?
i found two trees -- but not any kind of trees , trees with character -- and then a very long rope .
the mur@@ mu@@ r of the city diss@@ ol@@ ves into a squ@@ all whose chil@@ ling power i no longer feel .
you know that , right ?
i make the do@@ ve appear .
i want you just for a second to experience this amazing human symphony .
and what i &apos;d like to do is take you up to the canopy , not by putting all of you into ro@@ pes and har@@ ne@@ sses , but rather showing you a very short clip from a national geographic film called &quot; heroes of the high fron@@ tier . &quot;
we &apos;ve done stri@@ pping experiments where we &apos;ve removed mat@@ s of epi@@ phy@@ tes and looked at the rates of re@@ colon@@ ization .
we consul@@ t to the media about canopy questions ; we have a canopy new@@ sle@@ tter ; we have an email list@@ ser@@ v .
i saw the power of du@@ ke &apos;s song with urban youth -- an audience , you know , i as a middle-@@ aged professor , i don &apos;t have a hope of getting to -- in terms of convin@@ cing them of the importance of wild@@ lands .
i brought my scientific colleagues and sustainability prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ ers into the prison .
once upon a time , the world was a big , dys@@ functional family .
so we are moving to this democra@@ tiz@@ ation of information , and i &apos;ve been in this field for quite a while .
so that &apos;s open-source and it can be used in any country where there is some kind of freedom of information law .
skep@@ tici@@ sm , because you must always be challenging .
they &apos;re watching all of us . they &apos;ve du@@ g a base@@ ment , and they &apos;ve built a sp@@ y center to try and run algorithms and figure out which ones of us are trou@@ ble@@ some , and if any of us compla@@ in about that , we &apos;re arrested for terrorism .
now , when you think of a coral reef , this is what most people think of : all these big , hard , elabor@@ ate corals and lots of bright , color@@ ful fi@@ shes and things .
over time , those gas molecules diss@@ olve into your blood and tissues and start to fill you up .
and this ri@@ g was actually used for a dive of 300 feet .
now , as we breathe , we produce carbon dioxide , and that carbon dioxide needs to be sc@@ rub@@ bed out of the system .
and i can talk about it all day -- just ask my wife -- but i want to move on to something that &apos;s kind of much more interesting .
we also see sharks , much more reg@@ ularly than i would have expected to .
now , i don &apos;t know if any of you get u.s. news and world report -- i got the recent issue .
now , this one &apos;s pretty cool .
the reason i show this -- not to put a dow@@ ner on everything -- but i just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general , which is that we all have two goals .
despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders origin@@ ates in the brain , most of these disorders are diagnosed so@@ le@@ ly on the basis of obser@@ vable behavior .
research shows that 50 percent of children , almost 50 percent of children diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from hidden brain se@@ iz@@ ures .
they don &apos;t come back several times , so it really chron@@ ic@@ les a journey .
richard sa@@ ul w@@ ur@@ man : i remember hearing him talk at pen@@ n .

he could not probably give the right kind of love for you , but for us , he has given the people the right kind of love , that is important .
what if they look up at the night sky , at the same stars , but from the opposite side ?
where &apos;s the line that marks that ?
z@@ ir@@ con@@ s that are min@@ ed in the jack hills of western australia , z@@ ir@@ con@@ s taken from the jack hills of western australia tell us that within a few hundred million years of the origin of the planet there was abundant water and perhaps even life .
now dra@@ ke did not discover extr@@ at@@ er@@ restri@@ al intelligence , but he learned a very valuable lesson from a passing aircraft , and that &apos;s that ter@@ restri@@ al technology can inter@@ f@@ ere with the search for extr@@ at@@ er@@ restri@@ al technology .
so , if that &apos;s right , why did we only capture four out of those 15@@ 1 minds ?
come with me to the bottom of the world , antarctica , the highest , dri@@ est , w@@ indi@@ est , and yes , col@@ dest region on earth -- more ar@@ id than the sahar@@ a and , in parts , col@@ der than mars .
but under the surface is a hi@@ ve of industrial activity peri@@ o@@ di@@ cally , this drill , like a bi@@ op@@ sy needle , pl@@ un@@ ges thousands of feet deep into the ice to extract a marrow of gases and is@@ ot@@ op@@ es for analysis .
don &apos;t we already know the consequences of a changing climate on our sett@@ led civilization ?
the old story about climate protection is that it &apos;s co@@ stly , or it would have been done already .
and serious competition from europe , from korea , and next is china , which will soon be a major net ex@@ por@@ ter of cars .
it &apos;s fin@@ ance@@ able in the private capital market .
this is not very gra@@ ti@@ fying after more than a century of de@@ voted engineering effort .
each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set , instead of four expensive ones for st@@ am@@ ping steel .
for example , fe@@ e-@@ b@@ ates , a combination of a fe@@ e and a re@@ b@@ ate in any size class of vehicle you want , can increase the price of ine@@ fficient vehicles and correspon@@ din@@ gly pay you a re@@ b@@ ate for efficient vehicles .
and make the transition to more efficient vehicles go faster .
there &apos;s six billion dollars on the table .
we launched two ti@@ tles in october -- &quot; rocke@@ tt &apos;s new school &quot; -- the first of a series of products -- is about a character called rocke@@ tt beginning her first day of school in eigh@@ th grade at a brand new place , with a blank s@@ late , which allows girls to play with the question of , &quot; what will i be like when i &apos;m older ? &quot;
girl 6 : like , if you were a girl and you were really adv@@ ent@@ ur@@ ous and a real big tom@@ boy , you would think that girls &apos; games were kin@@ da si@@ ssy .
b@@ l : i &apos;m going to fast-@@ forward to the decision point because i know i don &apos;t have a lot of time .
br@@ en@@ da lau@@ re@@ l : games for girls
i also need alcohol and mor@@ ph@@ ine , because it &apos;s the only way i can work . &quot;
many soci@@ ologists like ve@@ bl@@ en and wol@@ fe would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously is because we &apos;re s@@ no@@ bs , because we &apos;re focused on status .
there are now dozens , perhaps hundreds of studies showing that if you believe you &apos;re drinking the expensive stuff , it ta@@ stes better to you .
people have mur@@ dered those that they loved , believing that they were mur@@ dering an im@@ poster .
then we asked them , &quot; how much would you pay for george clo@@ on@@ ey &apos;s swe@@ ater ? &quot;
they just don &apos;t like it .
as many of you know , this is the composition where the pi@@ ani@@ st sits at a ben@@ ch , opens up the piano and sits and does nothing for four minutes and 33 seconds -- that period of silence .
paul bloo@@ m : the origins of pleasure
so what i &apos;m going to show you is all of the main things , all of the main features of my discipline -- evi@@ den@@ ce@@ -based medicine .
&quot; a glass of red wine a day could help prevent breast cancer . &quot;
and the claim was fish oil pills improve school performance and behavior in mainstream children .
two sugar pills a day be@@ ats one sugar pill a day .
again , not an insane dose , not an illegal dose , but very much at the high end of normal .
so you can see here that the small negative trials that should be on the bottom left have disappeared .
we already have the data showing that it reduc@@ es the dur@@ ation of your flu by a few hours .
and pretty soon , they began shi@@ pping that coal , ton by ton , ra@@ il car by ra@@ il car , bo@@ at@@ load by bo@@ at@@ load , back to china and elsewhere around the world .
can you imagine what you would feel if you were in my shoes ?
it &apos;s all about oil ; you know that , everybody knows that .
there &apos;s this thing , this mil@@ it@@ ar@@ ization of the world , and it &apos;s cen@@ tered right in the united states .
and what do you see ? they &apos;re christians .
and this word here , george bush called this war a cru@@ sa@@ de .
you &apos;ve got to see this -- bible boo@@ t camp .
of course , you got it wrong .
and what i want you to do is picture her as a chinese woman receiving a chinese flag because her loved one has died in america in the coal u@@ pri@@ sing .
can you feel their anger , their fear , their rage at what has happened in their country ?
and suddenly , without realizing it , you &apos;re seeing the world differently .
communication walls , i don &apos;t have to tell you -- the internet -- have come tu@@ mbling down .
more than ever before it is these types of ideas which are driving growth on the cutting edge .
and that means an increase incentive to do research and development , which benefits everyone in the world .
i think of the great indian mathematician , ra@@ manu@@ j@@ an .
tw@@ enti@@ e@@ th century : a little bit over two percent .
when i was writing up my notes oil was $ 1@@ 40 per barrel .
if we were to wi@@ pe out insects alone , just that group alone , on this planet -- which we are trying hard to do -- the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land .
60,000 species are known to science , but more than 1.@@ 5 million have been estimated to exist .
what will we find as we map the living world , as , finally , we get this under@@ way seriously ?
human-@@ forced climate change alone -- again , if un@@ ab@@ ated -- could eliminate a quarter of survi@@ ving species during the next five decades .
it makes all key information about life on earth accessible to anyone , on demand , anywhere in the world .
well , commercial hunting happened .
sor@@ row , anger , m@@ our@@ ning .
there &apos;s just some bits that are b@@ and-@@ ta@@ iled pigeon .
al@@ ber@@ to worked with the bu@@ car@@ do in spain .
well birds are pretty hard-@@ wired , as it happens , so most of that is already in their dna , but to supp@@ lement it , part of ben &apos;s idea is to use hom@@ ing pige@@ ons to help train the young passenger pige@@ ons how to flo@@ ck and how to find their way to their old ne@@ sting grounds and feeding grounds .
another interesting project , though it &apos;s going to need some help , is the northern white r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os .
there &apos;s going to be un@@ intended consequences .
he ran and worked in a factory .
and i liked making that book because i loved using my imagination , and that &apos;s what writing is .
i drew funny pictures of my teachers -- -- and i passed them around .
i just wanted a video camera .
i set up a studio and i tried to get published .
mr@@ s. al@@ is@@ ch cut in front of the line and said , &quot; i taught him how to read . &quot;
i said , &quot; mr@@ s. al@@ is@@ ch , how are you ? &quot;
when i was visit@@ ing my ter@@ min@@ ally ill father in a hospital , i was asking myself , how does anybody get well in a place that sounds like this ?
this is affected ma@@ ssively by rever@@ ber@@ ation time , how rever@@ ber@@ ant a room is .
what does it cost to treat a classroom down to that 0.@@ 4@@ -@@ second rever@@ ber@@ ation time ?
i love that phrase .
in &quot; up@@ wake &quot; buildings wear suits , zero tap dan@@ ces on a giant keyboard , clon@@ es himself with a scanner , ta@@ mes and whi@@ ps the computer mice , sa@@ ils away into dre@@ am@@ scape from a single piece of paper and laun@@ ches into space .
but the teachers came to me after@@ ward and told me they hadn &apos;t seen the kids that atten@@ tive .
it &apos;s motion and emotion .
in the ne@@ therlands -- where i come from -- you actually never see a pig , which is really strange , because , on a population of 16 million people , we have 12 million pigs .
and in chee@@ se@@ cake and all kinds of de@@ ss@@ er@@ ts , like chocolate m@@ ous@@ se , ti@@ ra@@ mis@@ u , van@@ il@@ la pu@@ dding , everything that &apos;s cool@@ ed in the supermarket , there &apos;s gel@@ a@@ tin to make it look good .
and can you send me a bul@@ let ? &quot;
christi@@ en me@@ in@@ der@@ t@@ sm@@ a , author of &quot; pig 0@@ 50@@ 4@@ 9 &quot; looks at the astonishing after@@ life of the ordinary pig , parts of which make their way into at least 18@@ 5 non-@@ por@@ k products , from bul@@ lets to artificial hearts .
tell a kid you &apos;re sorry , they &apos;re in shock .
i have things to do , people to im@@ press , and places to go . &quot;
will you like all your children ? of course not .
now , this is one model of how language comes to be : namely , it &apos;s legis@@ lated by an academy .
a han@@ dy thing to have , because language is infinite , and you can &apos;t just par@@ rot back the sentences that you &apos;ve heard .
you can think of this as the language of thought , or &quot; mental@@ ese . &quot;
now , i &apos;m sure most of you have seen the movie &quot; far@@ go . &quot;
in dating , the transition from friendship to sex can lead to , no@@ tori@@ ously , various forms of awk@@ war@@ dness , and as can sex in the workplace , in which we call the conflict between a dominant and a sexual relationship &quot; sexual har@@ as@@ s@@ ment . &quot;
so you get the best of both worlds .
i tend to win those arguments , because i know the tricks .
so we have these models -- argument as war , argument as proof , and argument as performance .
oh , and one more thing , and as an educa@@ tor , this is the one that really bo@@ thers me : if argument is war , then there &apos;s an imp@@ licit equation of learning with losing .
what we need is new ex@@ it strategies for arguments .
why do we argue ? to out@@ -@@ reason our op@@ pon@@ ents , prove them wrong , and , most of all , to win ! ... right ? philosopher daniel h@@ . co@@ h@@ en shows how our most common form of argument -- a war in which one person must win and the other must lose -- mi@@ sses out on the real benefits of engaging in active disagre@@ ement . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
this is learning something , learning an idea , from an organism and then applying it .
learning about the natural world is one thing ; learning from the natural world -- that &apos;s the switch .
life can &apos;t afford to do that . how does life make things ?
imagine making all of our hard materials that way .
power of shape : here &apos;s a whale . we &apos;ve seen that the fin@@ s of this whale have tu@@ ber@@ cles on them . and those little bu@@ mps actually increase efficiency in , for instance , the edge of an airplane -- increase efficiency by about 32 percent .
and we use all of them , even the toxic ones .
ok , so that &apos;s the healing one .
and in ways both big and small , the narrative of the victim shapes the way we see women .
why are you so passionate ? &quot;
micro@@ finance is an incredibly powerful tool that leads to self-@@ su@@ ffici@@ ency and self-@@ respect , but we must move beyond micro-@@ hopes and micro-@@ ambi@@ tions for women , because they have so much greater hopes for themselves .
you know why ?
and when i was applying to business school and felt certain i couldn &apos;t do it and nobody i knew had done it , i went to my a@@ unt who survived years of beat@@ ings at the hand of her husband and es@@ cap@@ ed a marriage of abuse with only her dignity intact .
but it was a little bit boring .
but the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure , consistent no@@ vel@@ ty .
and now all be@@ ts are off .
and yet , all the press is focused on that .
about 10 years ago , i was at a cock@@ tail party with a friend of mine , and we &apos;re sitting there , and he was compla@@ ining about the crows that he had seen that were all over his yard and making a big mess .
and in all that area , they &apos;re only rarely found breeding more than five kilometers away from human beings .
so , it turns out we &apos;ve been finding more and more that crows are really , really intelligent .
in fact , that &apos;s old hat for crows .
so , when they get really used to that , we move on to the crows coming back .
i think that crows can be trained to do other things .
so the management of electro@@ lu@@ x took our pile , our list of incentives , and they went outside the room for 17 minutes , and they came back in and they said , &quot; wow , this is the most generous any community has ever been to try to keep jobs here .
as we know , only half the states have op@@ ted in .
every region has something to offer , and if you created a competition , it respe@@ cts the states and it respe@@ cts feder@@ alism .
if you hadn &apos;t noticed , our media climate generally provides a very distor@@ ted mirror of our lives and of our gender , and i think that &apos;s going to change .
when they &apos;re monitoring your cli@@ ck@@ stream -- and you know they are -- they have a really hard time figuring out your age , your gender and your income .
the future entertainment media that we &apos;re going to see is going to be very dat@@ a-@@ driven , and it &apos;s going to be based on the information that we as@@ certain from taste communities online , where women are really driving the action .
up goes the bird , out come the words , &quot; ju@@ ani@@ to , ju@@ ani@@ to , v@@ ent@@ e a com@@ er mi hi@@ jo ! &quot;
you might wan@@ na a@@ ver@@ t your ga@@ ze , because that is a new@@ t about to re@@ generate its limb , and shaking hands spreads more ger@@ ms than kis@@ sing .
okay . now on the left you can see the hand -- that &apos;s the big ar@@ row -- and the pen@@ is on the right . the hand ho@@ vering .
and i said , &quot; so , could you do it right here ? &quot;
i actually suggested to -- there is a researcher at the university of al@@ ab@@ ama who does org@@ asm research .
doctors back then were rout@@ inely telling men the importance of pleas@@ uring their wi@@ ves .
british sex@@ ologist ro@@ y lev@@ in has spe@@ cul@@ ated that this is perhaps why men evolved to be such enthusi@@ astic and frequ@@ ent ma@@ st@@ ur@@ bat@@ ors .
and i said , &quot; so why don &apos;t you just stimul@@ ate the c@@ lit@@ or@@ is of the pig ?
and the woman would have sex with it .
and yet , despite everything going really well for john , he was struggling , fighting addi@@ ction and a gri@@ pping depression .
now i know that seems lu@@ dic@@ rous .
pull the k@@ not .
and it seemed to me even he felt really bad facing these un@@ organized red squares day after day .
we are only happy when things are in order .
so we can also see that very clearly in this next painting .
and i think the whole thing ad@@ ds up much better if you do it like this .
but after a while , i just decided here to go all the way and put the paint back into the cans .
and i started to bring some order into some fla@@ gs .
he had a di@@ xi@@ eland jazz band when we were growing up , and he would always cover lou@@ is ar@@ m@@ strong tun@@ es .
and mom@@ s grab their kids out of the way and say , &quot; don &apos;t st@@ are ! &quot;
that &apos;s right , that &apos;s right ; i &apos;m no longer a victim .
it &apos;s as though intent is an essential component for humanity .
in fact , maybe that &apos;s the problem .
they were trying to answer the question of what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive ?
i was in a wheelchair ; i didn &apos;t look like a lo@@ ot@@ er .
this is what we must demand of our lives , of our objects , of our things , of our circumstances : living with intent .
i didn &apos;t have an exact address , but i knew his name , abed , i knew that he lived in a town of 1@@ 5,000 , k@@ far kar@@ a , and i knew that , 21 years before , just outside this holy city , he broke my neck .
but abed did not slow , and on that x@@ er@@ ox@@ ed piece of paper , my neck again broke , and again , i was left without anger .
were all of us the results of things done to us , done for us , the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of a parent or spo@@ use , money inher@@ ited ?
and as i sat con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating what to say , a woman approached in a black sha@@ wl and black ro@@ be .
no , i was quiet . i was quiet because i had not come for truth .
&quot; um , abed , &quot; i said , &quot; i thought you had a few driving issues before the crash . &quot;
yes , contrast .
i built the head . they built the body .
and it sees multiple people in a scene , reme@@ mbers where individual people are , and looks from person to person , rememb@@ ering people .
someone invited me to a meeting , but couldn &apos;t manage to fit me in to a regular sort of conference room meeting , and said , &quot; i have to walk my dogs tomorrow . could you come then ? &quot;
and i did a little calcu@@ lation of this .
for example , dan pink &apos;s talk on motivation , which was pretty good if you haven &apos;t seen it : &quot; drop car@@ rot . drop stick . bring meaning . &quot;
they used their six words to talk back to me and ask me if i &apos;d been too much on google l@@ ately .
and i would only pay $ 9@@ 9@@ .@@ 50 -- so stay even below a hundred dollars for it .
okay , part one starts back in 19@@ 29 when the great astronom@@ er ed@@ win hu@@ bble realized that the distant galaxies were all ru@@ shing away from us , establi@@ shing that space itself is stret@@ ching , it &apos;s expanding .
expressed in the relevant unit , it is spect@@ ac@@ ularly small .
so particle masses , the streng@@ ths of forces , and most importantly , the amount of dark energy would be determined by the shape of the extra dimensions .
and in those universes that have much less dark energy , well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that , again , galaxies don &apos;t form .
because such a mechanism has been found by cosmo@@ logists trying to understand the big bang .
you see , we learned that our universe is not static , that space is expanding , that that expansion is spee@@ ding up and that there might be other universes all by carefully exam@@ ining fa@@ int pin@@ points of star@@ light coming to us from distant galaxies .
we can understand how to understand the data from the micro@@ wave background radiation that was set down 1@@ 3.@@ 72 billion years ago -- and yet , we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it mat@@ ches .
you &apos;re going to meet milo for the first time .
you can le@@ an back , but the camera will change its perspective depending on which way you &apos;re looking .
milo : i wonder how deep it is .
now , to do that , we needed a set up , like a magician &apos;s trick .
you clean@@ ed up my room .
and suddenly she sees a tank am@@ b@@ ling down the main road of s@@ ara@@ j@@ ev@@ o kno@@ cking everything out of its path .
i believe a story there has to be told .
and that &apos;s pretty much why i do it .
and all i can really do is hope , not to poli@@ cy@@ makers or politicians , because as much as i &apos;d like to have faith that they read my words and do something , i don &apos;t delu@@ de myself .
and that &apos;s exactly what we did 10 years ago .
just fast forward 10 years .
as fast as we can re@@ set our computers , the brain activity shifts to start represen@@ ting this new tool , as if this too was a part of that primate &apos;s body .
and i was five years old , and i never understood why nasa didn &apos;t hire cap@@ tain k@@ ir@@ k and spo@@ ck to do the job ; after all , they were very prof@@ ici@@ ent -- but just seeing that as a kid made me believe , as my grandmother used to tell me , that &quot; impossible is just the possible that someone has not put in enough effort to make it come true . &quot;
why would we waste this money on you ? &quot;
and that brings me to my first major of two ten@@ ets of &quot; half the sky . &quot;
in india , in the first year of life , from zero to one , boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate because they depend upon the breast , and the breast shows no son pre@@ ference .
so what would some of the specific challenges look like ?
so that meant she was in@@ continent ; she couldn &apos;t control her wa@@ stes .
well , when she had her second daughter , her mother in-@@ law told her son , &quot; i think you &apos;d better get a second wife .
the tw@@ ins started producing milk .
we also think that individuals can make a difference , and they should , because individuals , together , we can all help create a movement .
sher@@ y@@ l w@@ u@@ dun@@ n &apos;s book &quot; half the sky &quot; investi@@ gates the op@@ pression of women globally . her stories shock . only when women in developing countries have equal access to education and economic opportunity will we be using all our human resources .
why not ? i mean , that &apos;s what we do .
and this cu@@ mu@@ lative cultural adap@@ tation , as anthropo@@ logists call this accu@@ mulation of ideas , is responsible for everything around you in your bu@@ st@@ ling and tee@@ ming everyday lives .
the other option we could choose was to develop the systems of communication that would allow us to share ideas and to co@@ operate amongst others .
and this is why our species has prosper@@ ed around the world while the rest of the animals sit behind bars in zo@@ os , langu@@ ishing .
and this is also true of some remote oce@@ an@@ ic islands .
to put it this way , nature knows no other circum@@ stance in which func@@ tionally equivalent traits co@@ exist .
biologist mark pa@@ gel shares an intriguing theory about why humans evolved our complex system of language . he suggests that language is a piece of &quot; social technology &quot; that allowed early human tribes to access a powerful new tool : cooperation .
and what i &apos;m most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its accompan@@ ying image , and how the image is transformed by the text and the text by the image .
this is the only feder@@ ally funded site where it is legal to cultiv@@ ate can@@ n@@ ab@@ is for scientific research in the united states .
this is the death star .
for the men in these photographs , the primary cause of their wr@@ ong@@ ful convic@@ tion was mista@@ ken identi@@ fication .
he ended up serving 18 and a half years of an 80 year sentence for rape and ro@@ b@@ ber@@ y .
last year alone , 99 feder@@ ally declar@@ ed disasters were on file with fe@@ ma , from j@@ op@@ lin , mi@@ ss@@ our@@ i , and tu@@ sc@@ alo@@ o@@ sa , al@@ ab@@ ama , to the central texas wild@@ fires that just happened recently .
so the first idea i had , initially , was just to go the federal and state governments and go , &quot; here , take it , for free . &quot;
our school would show bill ny@@ e the science guy .
we have dawn orb@@ iting ve@@ sta , and we have over here new horiz@@ ons on a straight shot to plu@@ to .
there &apos;s a point to be made here .
so given that that &apos;s true , how good are we at increasing our happiness ?
we also find that people are more a@@ verse to losing than they are happy to gain .
so when people &apos;s symptoms go away , they tend to re@@ cu@@ r , because there isn &apos;t a sense of the other half -- of what pleasure , happiness , compassion , gra@@ titude , what are the positive emotions .
it wouldn &apos;t eat . it wouldn &apos;t sleep . it wouldn &apos;t have sex .
and even studies of cooperation show that cooperation between individuals lights up reward centers of the brain .
i se@@ ize command by physical pro@@ w@@ ess , and i keep it by beating my chest , and you make sub@@ mis@@ sive ge@@ stures .
i end with a few quot@@ es .
why would you choose rats ?
once the animal knows click , food , click , food , click , food -- so click is food -- we bring it in a ca@@ ge with a hole , and actually the animal lear@@ ns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target sc@@ ent is placed , and to do that for five seconds -- five seconds , which is long for a rat .
it means that , if you have t@@ .@@ b@@ . , you have more chance that you won &apos;t be dete@@ cted , but will just die from t@@ .@@ b@@ . secon@@ dary infections and so on .
and by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and lo@@ op@@ ing those results back , we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent .
and this is truly the most amazing thing in the world .
now , what is the significance of these mirror neurons ?
in other words , if somebody tou@@ ches me , my hand , neuron in the som@@ ato@@ sensory cortex in the sensory region of the brain fires .
it emer@@ ges from our understanding of basic neuroscience .
so , that &apos;s 20 micro@@ meters across , that pollen grain there .
this is a bee &apos;s leg with the pollen gl@@ om@@ med onto it from a mal@@ low plant .
four very different habit@@ ats might look similar , but they &apos;ve got very different pollen sig@@ nat@@ ures .
it &apos;s certainly what i learned when i was training .
we have effective therap@@ ies now .
and she started , the women &apos;s health initiative .
some women have those heart attacks , but a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack , where it ero@@ des , doesn &apos;t completely fill with c@@ lot , symptoms are subtle , e@@ k@@ g findings are different -- fe@@ mal@@ e-@@ pattern .
now what are the implications of that ?
and those little red boxes are deaths .
we still have two to three more women dying for every man .
so if we can be as good as breast cancer and give women this new charge , we have a lot of lives to save .
we copy this in the lab by out@@ f@@ itting cell culture systems with electrodes .
and in the case of the fl@@ ora in our gut , these cells may not even be human .
but there &apos;s also a scientific reason that drove this project , which was to use this natural lon@@ g@@ itu@@ din@@ al data to understand the process of how a child lear@@ ns language -- that child being my son .
the way to interpret this apparently simple graph is , on the vertical is an indi@@ cation of how complex care@@ gi@@ ver utter@@ ances are based on the length of utter@@ ances .
now we free@@ ze the action , 30 minutes , we turn time into the vertical axis , and we open up for a view of these interaction traces we &apos;ve just left behind .
this has become my favorite way of vide@@ o@@ graph@@ ing just about any space .
and there are , again , now tens of millions of these links that give us the conne@@ ctive tissue of social graphs and how they relate to content .
and then i went on to reflect , &quot; isn &apos;t it amazing , this entire database , all these recor@@ dings , i &apos;m going to hand off to you and to your sister &quot; -- who arrived two years later -- &quot; and you guys are going to be able to go back and re-@@ experience moments that you could never , with your biological memory , possibly remember the way you can now ? &quot;
mit researcher de@@ b ro@@ y wanted to understand how his inf@@ ant son learned language -- so he wired up his house with vide@@ o@@ cameras to catch every moment of his son &apos;s life , then par@@ sed 9@@ 0,000 hours of home video to watch &quot; ga@@ a@@ a@@ a &quot; slowly turn into &quot; water . &quot; astonishing , dat@@ a-@@ rich research with deep implications for how we learn .
a second part of the brain is called the dor@@ sal stream .
we make meaning by seeing , by an act of visual inter@@ ro@@ gation .
secondly , making them interactive .
this is a laun@@ dry ch@@ u@@ te , and this right here is a shoe last .
but i get a lot of toilets , and so you just disp@@ at@@ ch a toilet with a ham@@ mer , and then you have lu@@ mp@@ y tiles .
but you &apos;ve never seen this one before .
and in there he said that cultures tend to s@@ wing between one of two perspe@@ ctives .
and so if something isn &apos;t standard , &quot; o@@ ops , du@@ mp@@ ster . &quot; &quot; o@@ ops &quot; this . &quot; o@@ ops , war@@ ped . &quot;
the problem is we can &apos;t afford it .
all we have to do is look at what one company did with carb@@ on@@ ated pr@@ un@@ e juice .
that exac@@ er@@ b@@ ates and continues this model .
that is , our housing has become a commodity .
in this funny and insi@@ ght@@ ful talk , buil@@ der dan phil@@ li@@ ps t@@ ours us through a dozen homes he &apos;s built in texas using recycled and re@@ cla@@ imed materials in wil@@ dly creative ways . brilliant , low-@@ tech design details will re@@ fresh your own creative drive . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and the reason i think it would be so interesting to you is because consciousness is so interesting .
there is no more dra@@ stic and sudden gap created between potential and actual mind than a severe head injury .
but if you look into the eye of consciousness , that single eye you can see , i &apos;m looking down , but let me tell you how i felt at that point .
the global perspective is that up to 30 percent of children in school have learning wea@@ kne@@ sses that are not self-@@ corre@@ cting , but with appropriate treatment , they can be scre@@ ened for and dete@@ cted and corre@@ cted and avoid their academic failure .
the answer is yes , and for the first time , it &apos;s my pleasure to be able to share two examples .
imagine the blood flowing through your body -- i was told at uc@@ la medical center -- as one se@@ aled system .
so it goes in and it stays there .
and so i was sitting in this restaurant , waiting for a man to come by who obviously would have some difficulty ...
and if you walk faster , if i walk faster , it dete@@ cts what &apos;s called the time inter@@ val , which is the inter@@ val between each he@@ el lift .
and i started in our medical university , kar@@ ol@@ in@@ sk@@ a institute , an under@@ graduate course called global health . but when you get that opportunity , you get a little nervous . i thought , these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in swe@@ dish college systems -- so , i thought , maybe they know everything i &apos;m going to teach them about . so i did a pre-@@ test when they came .
now what has happened since 196@@ 2 ? we want to see the change .
where are the different countries ? i can show you africa .
yemen , civil war . united arab e@@ mi@@ rate , money which was quite equally and well used .
everything in this world exists in africa . and you can &apos;t discuss universal access to hiv &#91; medicine &#93; for that qu@@ in@@ tile up here with the same strategy as down here . the improvement of the world must be highly contex@@ tu@@ alized , and it &apos;s not relevant to have it on regi@@ onal level . we must be much more detailed .
and that &apos;s a quite clever guy , huh ?
but it slightly bo@@ res me .
so i had a really quite happy life at indi@@ ana .
and certainly , neither cri@@ ck or i were chemi@@ sts , so we tried to build a model . and he knew , fran@@ c@@ is knew wil@@ kins .
and i read it , and it was just -- it was cra@@ p .
and we knew we were right .
but that &apos;s the only -- no , we were only photographed twice .
so , we started with breast cancer because there &apos;s lots of money for it , no government money .
were they crazy also , and we didn &apos;t know it ?
you need to know that the average patent tro@@ ll defense costs two million dollars and takes 18 months when you win .
now what did i learn from this case ? well , three things .
behold , patent inf@@ rin@@ gement via mobile device -- defined as a computer which is not sta@@ tionary .
it was a huge success .
they laugh@@ ed together .
now i bet , in this audience , you &apos;re thinking of some really incredible technology , some stuff that i haven &apos;t even heard of , i &apos;m absolutely sure .
bru@@ ce a@@ yl@@ ward : o@@ ops . j@@ on , polio &apos;s almost been eradi@@ cated .
so what we &apos;re looking for is a permanent solution .
it deter@@ i@@ or@@ ates so quickly in the tro@@ pic@@ s that we &apos;ve had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it &apos;s exposed to too much heat , and we can tell that it &apos;s not a good vaccine to use on a child -- it &apos;s not potent ; it &apos;s not going to protect them .
within a couple of years , every country that started polio eradi@@ cation rapidly eradi@@ cated all three of their polio viruses , with the exception of four countries that you see here .
he lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters .
and this started an incredible collaboration with industry , and within six months , we were testing a new polio vaccine that targe@@ ted , just two years ago , the last two types of polio in the world .
it &apos;s ready to reach them with bed nets , with other things .
and is it easy to raise that money ?
and she took us on a journey and revealed something very special to us -- her own daughter , eight days old .
d@@ j : now one of the big things , of course , everybody knows that cats hate water , and so this was a real revel@@ ation for us .
b@@ j : so , as der@@ e@@ ck says , we have to work through extre@@ mes -- extreme temperatures , push ourselves at night .
it was phenomenal , and we felt grateful that she trusted us to that extent .
but i have to tell you -- everybody always asks , &quot; what happened to the baby bab@@ o@@ on ? &quot;
and that &apos;s probably because we haven &apos;t seen it like we are today .
my title : &quot; que@@ er@@ er than we can suppose : the stran@@ gen@@ ess of science . &quot;
science has taught us , against all intuition , that apparently solid things , like cryst@@ als and rocks , are really almost entirely com@@ posed of empty space .
if we &apos;d evolved in a vacuum , we would expect them to hit the ground simultaneously . if we were bacteria , constantly bu@@ ffe@@ ted by thermal movements of molecules , it would be different , but we middle worl@@ ders are too big to notice brow@@ ni@@ an motion .
what we see of the real world is not the un@@ v@@ ar@@ ni@@ shed world but a model of the world , regul@@ ated and adju@@ sted by sense data , but constructed so it &apos;s useful for dealing with the real world .
mirac@@ les are just events that are extremely im@@ prob@@ able .
we &apos;d be different , our characters would be different , if our neuro@@ -@@ an@@ at@@ omy and our physi@@ ological chemistry were different .
i went to no@@ t@@ re da@@ me university and graduated with degrees in accoun@@ ting and german , including spending a year of study in au@@ stri@@ a .
all of us have dis@@ abilities in one form or another .
can you show us how good of a pilot you are ?
moving on from this , the next person to explore this field was a gentleman called hans jen@@ ny in the 1970s .
then on the right we can see a cy@@ matically created s@@ now@@ fla@@ ke .
their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and , as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of con@@ science , change became not only possible , but inevitable .
and it &apos;s terribly endangered .
and you don &apos;t necessarily have the sense that twitter is in fact a very heavi@@ ly braz@@ i@@ lian space .
it &apos;s the economy of moving these heavy , slow atoms over long distances that &apos;s very difficult to do .
you start looking at how the global plane f@@ lights move , and you suddenly discover that the world isn &apos;t even close to flat .
when you look at the new york times , you look at other elite media , what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations and the nations we &apos;ve inv@@ aded .
nor do i think we are by ourselves , actually going to solve the problem .
there &apos;s a group right now in china called ye@@ ey@@ an .
not only does she have to keep our israeli and palestinian contribu@@ tors from killing each other , she has to figure out what is going to interest you about the middle east .
he knows one world , and he &apos;s finding a way to communicate it to another world , both of which he has deep connections to .
we have to fix our im@@ migration policy .
in afghanistan , for example , we haven &apos;t just had one election or two elections . we &apos;ve gone through three elections , presi@@ dential and parli@@ am@@ ent@@ ary . and what do we find ?
it &apos;s not that it guaran@@ te@@ es peace with itself or with its neighbors .
the public is losing faith in democracy , says british mp r@@ ory stewart . iraq and afghanistan &apos;s new democr@@ acies are deeply corru@@ pt ; meanwhile , 8@@ 4 percent of people in britain say politics is broken . in this important talk , stewart sounds a call to action to rebuild democracy , starting with recognizing why democracy is important -- not as a tool , but as an ideal .
the short answer is , actually , they &apos;re from japan .
this is a bill@@ board that says : &quot; welcome to the birth@@ place of general t@@ so . &quot;
let &apos;s go back to mid-@@ 18@@ 0@@ 0s when the chinese first came to america .
for example , there is french chinese food , where they serve salt and pe@@ pper frog legs .
so , like , ok , maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper -- you know , like , it was a diam@@ ond , or , you know , diag@@ onal .
so me , general t@@ so &apos;s chicken and this logo are all kar@@ mac@@ ally related .
finally , in about the six@@ teen@@ th century , a physician whose name was the@@ op@@ h@@ ra@@ st@@ us bom@@ ba@@ st@@ us au@@ re@@ ol@@ us von ho@@ hen@@ he@@ im , called par@@ ac@@ el@@ sus , a name probably familiar to some people here -- -- good , old par@@ ac@@ el@@ sus found that he could predict the degree of con@@ vul@@ sion by using a measured amount of cam@@ ph@@ or to produce the con@@ vul@@ sion .
he rela@@ p@@ sed a little bit , they gave him a series of treatments , and he was essentially cu@@ red .
it had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke english , no one could read or write english .
and they tried everything they had .
well , he said , &quot; can &apos;t we try a course of electro@@ shock therapy ? &quot;
and things got better and better , and within three or four months , i was dis@@ charged from that hospital , and i joined a group of surgeons where i could work with other people in the community , not in new haven , but fairly close by .
so one of the reasons that i have come here to talk about this today is to -- frankly , sel@@ fish@@ ly -- un@@ burden myself and let it be known that this is not an un@@ troub@@ led mind that has written all of these books .
i believe the concept of global citiz@@ en@@ ship will simply grow out of people talking to each other across continents .
now , what is remarkable is that civil rights in america were achieved in the 1960s .
but i think this is the fru@@ stration that perhaps a lot people have , like people in the audience here , where we love the kind of language that you &apos;re talking about .
and we have had a speaker who said that very thing , and swal@@ lo@@ wed a s@@ word right after that , which was quite dramatic .
i mean , the great difficulty in europe is if you &apos;re at a meeting and 27 people speak , it takes a very very long time .
and then the secretary general of the united nations &quot; when will our international institutions work ? &quot;
so the question is , how do you re@@ invent something that has been around for five millen@@ nia ?
and the most remarkable fe@@ at is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that .
and you see here a picture of a tissue section .
some of the greatest innovations and develop@@ ments in the world often happen at the inter@@ section of two fields .
if you don &apos;t like the subject or the performance , you can hold the red .
data : a couple of new jer@@ sey hun@@ ters are out in the woods .
so this is actually the first time we &apos;ve ever done live audience feedback to a performance .
what can we do together that benefits us both ?
stran@@ gen@@ ess is that cali@@ bration of clo@@ sen@@ ess and distance that enables me to find the people that i need right now , that enables me to find the sources of intimacy , of discovery , and of inspiration that i need right now .
it all began for him during world war ii , when at age 17 he found himself th@@ ru@@ st into a for@@ ged documents work@@ shop .
i was born in alg@@ eria .
so at the age of 14 my father had to work .
but it was only the beginning .
he also explained to me that i had a brother , too , and the first time i saw them i must have been three or four , and they were 30 years older than me .
europe was not spar@@ ed either .
this is bad news , but perhaps surprising to you , it &apos;s also part of the good news .
never have we seen , in the past 50 years , such a sharp decline of ecosystem functions and services on the planet , one of them being the ability to regul@@ ate climate on the long term , in our forests , land and biodiversity .
as a side@@ line , you know that the only red flag that po@@ pped up here was a sub@@ marine from an un@@ named country that planted a red flag at the bottom of the arctic to be able to control the oil resources .
what you see here in black line is the safe operating space , the quanti@@ fied boundaries , as suggested by this analysis .
under the realization from tou@@ rist oper@@ ators , fisher@@ men , the austr@@ alian great barrier reef authority and scientists that the great barrier reef is do@@ om@@ ed under the current governance regime .
the key though in all of these , the red th@@ read , is the shift in mindset , moving away from a situation where we simply are pushing ourselves into a dark future , where we instead back@@ cast our future , and we say , &quot; what is the playing field on the planet ?
though it &apos;s actually true , you know , the reason i &apos;m talking to you right now is because i was born in brazil .
but i wasn &apos;t into selling whis@@ key ; i was into selling ice .
&quot; the sna@@ il . &quot;
this is &quot; 6@@ ,500 yards , &quot; after cor@@ ot . &quot; 9@@ ,000 yards , &quot; after ger@@ hard rich@@ ter .
they do a dna scan of this , they will come up with a great ma@@ iling list .
a han@@ ger .
and we can then see the result of such mutations when we compare dna sequences among us here in the room , for example .
and later , between 100 and 50,000 years ago or so , went out of africa to colon@@ ize the rest of the world .
there is another thing with those traits that we so easily observe in each other that i think is worth@@ while to consider , and that is that , in a very liter@@ al sense , they &apos;re really on the surface of our bodies .
statisti@@ cally speaking , there is no difference in how often the neander@@ thal mat@@ ches one african or the other .
they meet neanderthals , mix with them , continue to spread over the world , and somewhere in sou@@ theast asia , they meet den@@ iso@@ v@@ ans and mix with them and continue on out into the pacific .
so sustainability is quite important for us , which should in@@ corporate social but as well as environmental and economic values .
so let &apos;s compare the old world with the new world .
we have social areas inside the aircraft which might turn into a place where you can play virtual golf .
these are survival skills .
this is our body wisdom . it &apos;s not something that is medi@@ ated by our language . our body just knows that , and we &apos;ve known that for a long time .
there are millions of individuals with autism all around us .
well , it &apos;s hard to do that , so we had to create the technologies . we had to basically step inside a body .
it &apos;s almost as if that stimul@@ us , you , you &apos;re not ex@@ er@@ ting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives .
early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder can improve the lives of everyone affected , but the complex network of causes make it incredibly difficult to predict . at ted@@ x@@ pe@@ ach@@ tree , ami k@@ lin describes a new early detection method that uses ey@@ e-@@ tracking technologies to g@@ au@@ ge babies &apos; social engagement skills and reli@@ ably measure their risk of developing autism . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
if you &apos;re an out@@ board person@@ nel , now you stand up .
you are going to hit the ground .
i was raised with traditional stories of leadership : robert e@@ . lee , john bu@@ ford at ge@@ t@@ ty@@ s@@ burg .
more importantly , the force that i led was spread over more than 20 countries .
i asked , &quot; where were you on 9 / 11 ? &quot;
i learned they are the sin@@ e@@ w which hold the force together .
and if you &apos;re a leader , the people who count on you need you on your feet .
she then as@@ signed these works rac@@ ial identi@@ ties , basically saying to me that the work on the right , clearly , was made by a black artist , the work on the left , clearly , by a white artist , when , in effect , that was the opposite case : bob co@@ le@@ scott , afri@@ can@@ -@@ american artist ; le@@ on go@@ lu@@ b , a white artist .
what that might mean for cultural movements all over this moment , the &quot; me , we &quot; seems incredibly pre@@ sci@@ ent totally important .
so , what do i discover when i look at art@@ works ?
they down@@ loaded it from dis@@ ne@@ y@@ .com , or one of these websites , 14 days after putting the computer in their village .
this is a 15 year-old boy .
i called in 26 children .
but 30 percent is not a pass .
i gave them six g@@ c@@ se questions .
you can &apos;t catch me .
they ty@@ ped it into google , translated it into italian , went back into italian google .
&#91; &quot; o@@ edi@@ pus re@@ x &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; the lion king &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; titu@@ s &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; fri@@ da &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; the magic flu@@ te &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; across the universe &quot; &#93; ju@@ lie ta@@ y@@ mor : thank you . thank you very much .
the next moment , as soon as they finished and disappeared into the sha@@ dows , a young man with a pro@@ pan@@ e lan@@ ter@@ n came on , hun@@ g it up on a tree , set up a cur@@ tain .
i love the ap@@ parent truth of theater .
ari@@ el : i boar@@ ded the king &apos;s ship . in every ca@@ bin , i fla@@ med ama@@ ze@@ ment .
and as she was there on the edge of that stage , two sta@@ ge@@ hands all in black with wat@@ ering cans ran along the top and started to pour water on the sand ca@@ stle , and the sand ca@@ stle started to dri@@ p and sink , but before it did , the audience saw the black@@ -@@ cla@@ d sta@@ ge@@ hands .
what the hell are we doing up there on that stage ?
ju@@ lie ta@@ y@@ mor : spi@@ der@@ -@@ man , the lion king and life on the creative edge
you choose . it &apos;s your ba@@ k@@ ery , your street , your country -- not mine . &quot;
and so , on a mic@@ ro level , there &apos;s a real role for this combination of investment and philanthropy .
and i really understood what patient capital meant emo@@ tionally in the last month or so . because the company was literally 10 days away from pro@@ ving that the product they produced was at the world-@@ quality level needed to make co@@ ar@@ te@@ m , when they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history .
in our first year , the first net went off the line in october of 2003 .
she was very much like those women sitting behind the se@@ wing machines .
now , when we first started talking to ok go -- the name of the song is &quot; this too shall pass &quot; -- we were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with .
the machine itself would start the music .
it doesn &apos;t matter what temperature it is , doesn &apos;t matter what &apos;s in its way ; it will pretty much get where it needs to go .
and now to introduce their music video , we have ok go .
and so we built some very sophisticated radio anten@@ n@@ as just for prob@@ ing both walls and searching for an air gap .
so we thought of an au@@ gmented reality application using a tab@@ let . let me show you just simul@@ ating what we could be doing , any of us could be doing , in a museum environment .
and the later it fail@@ s , the worse the consequences .
it &apos;s a disease that runs in my family , and we really hope that cells like these will help us find a cure .
i &apos;ve tried to show in this -- though the color doesn &apos;t come out -- that what i &apos;m concerned with is the little 50-@@ year time bubble that you are in . you tend to be interested in a generation past , a generation future -- your parents , your kids , things you can change over the next few decades -- and this 50-@@ year time bubble you kind of move along in . and in that 50 years , if you look at the population curve , you find the population of humans on the earth more than doub@@ les and we &apos;re up three-@@ and-@@ a-half times since i was born . when you have a new baby , by the time that kid gets out of high school more people will be added than existed on earth when i was born .
your great-@@ great grandparents got by on muscle power , and yet we all think there &apos;s this huge power that &apos;s essential for our lifestyle . and with all the wonderful technology we have we can do things that are much more efficient : con@@ serve , re@@ cycle , etc .
it &apos;s part of a long-term program nasa spon@@ so@@ red .
all right .
well , inspired by the sentences , i decided to wi@@ eld the paint@@ brush .
thank you .
&quot; it &apos;d be like putting a piece of to@@ ast through a bas@@ ket@@ ball hoo@@ p , wouldn &apos;t it ? &quot;
over thousands of years ago , he proved that for us .
he proved it was prime with nothing more than a qu@@ ill , ink , paper and his mind .
it took him , by his estimate , &quot; three years of sun@@ days . &quot;
it &apos;s because of cur@@ tis co@@ op@@ er that we know , currently the largest prime number we know , is 2 ^ 5@@ 7@@ ,@@ 8@@ 8@@ 5@@ ,@@ 16@@ 1 .
we live in an age where some of the great break@@ through@@ s are not going to happen in the labs or the h@@ alls of acade@@ mia but on laptops , desk@@ tops , in the pal@@ ms of people &apos;s hands who are simply helping out for the search .
and what was so gorgeous about this discovery was 50 years ago peter higgs and his team considered one of the deepest of all questions : how is it that the things that make us up have no mass ?
in fact , growing up in tas@@ man@@ ia , it always was incredibly exciting when we got a chance to see a tas@@ mani@@ an devil in the wild .
scientists around the world were intrigu@@ ed by this cancer , this infe@@ c@@ tious cancer , that was spreading through the tas@@ mani@@ an devil population .
he &apos;s a tas@@ mani@@ an devil that we found with a large tumor on his face .
he &apos;s a dog that belongs to a family in mom@@ bas@@ a in kenya .
however , under some circumstances , it can happen .
so if we &apos;re married , we &apos;re more likely to have kids .
so most of us put ourselves above average on most of these abilities .
number two : regardless of the outcome , the pure act of antici@@ pation makes us happy .
so they tend to expect the future to be worse than it ends up being .
but if someone started off saying , &quot; my average likelihood of suffering from cancer is about 10 percent , &quot; and we said , &quot; hey , bad news .
and what he &apos;s doing is he &apos;s passing a small magnetic pulse through the skull of the particip@@ ant in our study into their inf@@ eri@@ or frontal gy@@ rus .
and i believe there &apos;s a way for us to do that .
it really should be called the recovery or return of asia .
but think of what it does to how we think in traditional terms and concepts .
the te@@ ct@@ onic plates of world politics were shifting .
you know , it looks at economic power measured by gdp .
and as i said earlier , china has not passed the united states .
now i don &apos;t mean to be pol@@ ly@@ an@@ na@@ ish about this .
in fact , they &apos;ve accoun@@ ted for half of all civil wars .
and why is it so difficult initially ?
so the don@@ ors have to stick with this situation for at least a decade .
and indeed , unfortunately , if you navigate by needs you get a very un@@ focused agenda , because in these situations , needs are everywhere , but the capacity to imple@@ ment change is very limited .
there &apos;s one sector which isn &apos;t exposed to international trade , and which can generate a lot of jobs , and which is , in any case , a sen@@ sible sector to expand , post-@@ conflict , and that is the construction sector .
the planning function and policy function stays with the ministry ; the delivery of services on the ground , you should use whatever works -- chur@@ ches , ngos , local communities , whatever works .
what &apos;s the goal ?
there are important distribu@@ tional consequences , and they &apos;re not what you always might think .
we need better planning and systems for ev@@ acu@@ ation .
it makes sense , right ? there &apos;s open space , the planes can take off and land without worrying about creating noise or avo@@ i@@ ding tall buildings .
there are no quick fi@@ xes .
t : most importantly ... s : most importantly ...
j@@ w : so is english man@@ ia good or bad ?
now this has raised all sorts of questions .
and he asked that particular person , what do crows and fish have in common ?
they weren &apos;t willing to engage in this .
well , in 19@@ 00 , three percent of americans practic@@ ed profes@@ sions that were cogni@@ tively deman@@ ding .
now over the last century , in developed nations like america , moral debate has es@@ cal@@ ated because we take the hypothe@@ tical seriously , and we also take univer@@ s@@ als seriously and look for logical connections .
you have to say , well , black@@ ness of skin , you couldn &apos;t suffer just for that .
one of the ways in which we would like to deal with the sophisti@@ cation of the modern world is through politics , and sadly you can have human@@ e moral principles , you can classi@@ fy , you can use logic on abstr@@ actions , and if you &apos;re ignor@@ ant of history and of other countries , you can &apos;t do politics .
i &apos;m a public school teacher , and i just want to share a story of my super@@ inten@@ dent .
it could have been denti@@ stry , but the word &quot; experimental &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what i had to go for .
it &apos;s a story that &apos;s a te@@ st@@ ament to teaching and teachers .
and so that gesture of my mother &apos;s continues through many generations .
i offer them the job , they can turn it down , and then they choose their own ca@@ bin@@ et .
see , mr. hun@@ ter is doing that because he says his time has me@@ ssed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fix that problem .
this is the world peace game . what is wrong with you ? &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s ask that mom to read the letter .
this is about my friend br@@ en@@ n@@ an .
he rings the bell again . he says , &quot; we have &quot; -- and there &apos;s 12 seconds left on the clock -- &quot; we have , all nations , po@@ ol@@ ed all our funds together .
in india , we had the na@@ x@@ al@@ ite movement , the &#91; unclear &#93; movement .
when you pump in air in a bicycle , you use a bit of this .
they always make a tri@@ an@@ gu@@ lar roof .
now this is a little pump with which you could in@@ fl@@ ate a balloon .
but this is great fun for children .
i just put this inside this .
they are f@@ used together , so you can &apos;t separate them .
there are no patents . anyone can make it .
this is called &quot; the cap@@ tain &apos;s hat story . &quot;
and the ship sin@@ ks , and the cap@@ tain has lost everything , but for a life jac@@ ket .
so i &apos;m going to talk about some projects that have explo@@ red these ideas .
the way we tend to use resources is we extract them , we turn them into short-@@ life products and then dis@@ pose of them .
and we &apos;d also have a coffee shop , and the waste grains from that could be used as a sub@@ str@@ ate for growing mushrooms .
so amazing example of an adap@@ tation to a very resour@@ ce@@ -@@ constra@@ ined environment -- and in that sense , very relevant to the kind of challenges we &apos;re going to be facing over the next few years , next few decades .
so this is how this sche@@ me would look .
they &apos;re not just possible ; they &apos;re critical .
and if i want to start having children by the time i &apos;m 35 , that meant that i would have had to have been on my way to marriage five years ago .
now , there was one small catch .
and they say to me , &quot; stop compla@@ ining . &quot;
for me , the ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es that i have are really just new work projects that i &apos;ve launched .
she said she is &quot; silly , nice and friendly . &quot;
remember , i &apos;m somebody who said that i speak flu@@ ent japanese and i know ja@@ vas@@ cri@@ pt and i was okay with that .
obviously , i &apos;m having a fabulous life , so -- -- the question is , what does all of this mean for you ?
i know most of you have had the experience of coming back home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games .
imagine you &apos;re driving in a fo@@ g . that makes a difference between seeing the car in front of you and avo@@ i@@ ding the accident , or getting into an accident .
but a few kids are sad and blue because they &apos;ve forgotten their coat .
that &apos;s a multi@@ medi@@ a-@@ tas@@ ker .
so let me illustrate that step with a task which is called mental ro@@ tation .
da@@ ph@@ ne ba@@ ve@@ li@@ er : your brain on video games
you get something a little bit more complicated .
well , this has deep implications about the limits of science , about predict@@ ability and contro@@ ll@@ ability of things like biological processes or economies , about intelligence in the universe , about questions like free will and about creating technology .
so let &apos;s try asking a question , like a health related question .
so , i &apos;m pretty ple@@ ased with it all .
then , the idea is that wol@@ fra@@ m alpha will be able to figure out what precise pieces of code can do what they &apos;re asking for and then show them examples that will let them pick what they need to build up bigger and bigger , precise programs .
but in at least a large class of cases , one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network , which , when it gets big enough , beha@@ ves like continuous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can behave like a continuous fluid .
that was astonishing .
there are very few doctors and , quite frankly , these countries do not have the resources that are needed to c@@ ope with such epide@@ mics .
and this is only done in four hours , 50 times faster than the current state of the art , at a cost that will be five to 500 times cheaper than the current options .
it &apos;s because my mother was den@@ ied an education , and she constantly reminded me and my si@@ blin@@ gs that she never wanted us to live the life she was living .
well , my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass .
i was lucky because one , also , my mom did something that most women don &apos;t do .
this should have been given to a boy . we can &apos;t do this . &quot;
i learned that she did not have to be ab@@ used because she is a woman .
and yes , she was older to be in fourth grade .
and we will live in a very peaceful world . thank you very much .
it took us 50 years to reach annual savings rat@@ ings of almost 10 percent . 50 years .
so we &apos;re starting to pay for things with money that we have .
we &apos;re going to go through four valu@@ e-@@ shifts that we see driving new consumer behaviors , that offer new management principles .
another quick example of these types of movements is the rise of z@@ yn@@ ga .
but they also talk about the fact that their execu@@ tives , all of their expen@@ se reports are put onto their company in@@ tran@@ et for everyone to see .
another great example is fi@@ del@@ ity .
the traditional thing would be to boy@@ cot@@ t right ?
it &apos;s been tremend@@ ously powerful for consumers .
i know a woman who &apos;s good at this .
go home to your husband -- what does he need ?
in fact , i grew up obser@@ ving two different kinds of wom@@ an@@ hood .
we tend to form clu@@ sters based on simil@@ arity , and then we produce stereoty@@ pes about other clu@@ sters of people .
i ski@@ pped school often and dre@@ amed of becoming a sa@@ il@@ or during those days .
for me , like millions of other people around the world today , english is an acquired language .
many authors feel this pressure , but non-@@ western authors feel it more heavi@@ ly .
but there were times when i wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction .
books have saved the intro@@ ver@@ ted , ti@@ mi@@ d child that i was -- that i once was .
aud@@ re lor@@ de once said , &quot; the white fathers taught us to say , &apos; i think , therefore i am . &apos; &quot; she suggested , &quot; i feel , therefore i am free . &quot;
i think these are the basic elements of all creativity .
now , american copyright and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others .
that is all there is to it . apple has pat@@ ented this .
he records a song called &quot; blind wil@@ lie mc@@ tell , &quot; named after the blu@@ es singer , and the song is a voy@@ age through the past , through a much dar@@ ker time , but a simpler one , a time when musicians like wil@@ lie mc@@ tell had few illu@@ sions about what they did .
just look at google maps here . there &apos;s block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
and one of the first victims of difficult economic times , i think , is public spending of any kind , but certainly in the firing line at the moment is public spending for science , and particularly curi@@ o@@ sit@@ y-@@ led science and exploration .
it &apos;s about 500 kilometers in diameter .
so below the ice , there &apos;s an ocean of liquid around the whole moon .
well , this looks like a picture of virtually nothing .
and one of the astonishing predictions of quantum mechanics , just by looking at the structure of atoms -- the same theory that describes transi@@ stors -- is that there can be no stars in the universe that have reached the end of their life that are bigger than , quite specifically , 1.@@ 4 times the mass of the sun .
it was made in stars like that , locked away and then returned to the universe in explo@@ sions like that in order to recon@@ dense into planets , stars , new solar systems and , indeed , people like us .
but it visited ju@@ pit@@ er , saturn , ur@@ an@@ us and ne@@ p@@ tune .
thank you .
the red dots you see up there are sites that are behavioral tracking that i have not navi@@ gated to , but are following me .
pretty simple -- it &apos;s huge business .
thank you for being here .
you &apos;re walking to make us feel bad . &quot;
i was 27 . i thought i knew everything .
and they said , &quot; don &apos;t worry about that . &quot;
now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion .
my dad said , &quot; that &apos;s one , &quot; and i still didn &apos;t let that go .
i was walking through el dor@@ a@@ do -- it &apos;s a prison town , famous prison , or in@@ famous prison -- in vene@@ zu@@ ela , and i don &apos;t know what posse@@ ssed me , because this was not like me .
but i know i needed to .
but even as a child , i could feel the hea@@ v@@ iness in their hearts .
hope kept me alive .
my father tried very hard to motiv@@ ate me into studying , but it didn &apos;t work .
in north korea , i made it myself .
i just wanted to say that i miss you , and i love you , and please come back to me and stay alive .
i was asked to design the building , because the theme of the exp@@ o was environmental issues .
that &apos;s the responsibility of architects .
i started commu@@ ting to ko@@ be , and i met the society of vietna@@ me@@ se people .
i brought my japanese students to work with the chinese students .
i used the shi@@ pping contain@@ er and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfortable .
and those two ro@@ les came together for me in a book that i wrote called &quot; origins . &quot;
now why would this kind of fe@@ tal learning be useful ?
and often it does something more .
when food is scar@@ ce , they diver@@ t nutrients towards the really critical organ , the brain , and away from other organs like the heart and liver .
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about p@@ ts@@ d .
mt : this faith in the fic@@ tional is essential for any kind of the@@ atri@@ cal experience .
the audience is led to make assumptions or elabor@@ ations that are perfectly reasonable , but do not , in fact , match what is being done in front of them .
and if the story is a good one , it might even make us smile .
so what i &apos;m asking for is the creation of a new job title -- i &apos;ll come to this a little later -- and perhaps the addition of a new word into the english language .
but i was at a ted event recently and es@@ ther du@@ fl@@ o , probably one of the leading experts in , effectively , the eradi@@ cation of poverty in the developing world , actually spoke .
one of them also being , although logically it &apos;s quite a good idea to have a lift with no up and down button in it , if it only ser@@ ves two flo@@ ors , it &apos;s actually bloo@@ dy terrifying , okay ?
because , if the board of dire@@ ctors convince everybody that the success of any organization is almost entirely dependent on the decisions made by the board of dire@@ ctors , it makes the dis@@ par@@ ity in sal@@ aries slightly more justi@@ fi@@ able than if you actually ac@@ knowledge that quite a lot of the credit for a company &apos;s success might actually lie somewhere else , in small pieces of tac@@ tical activity .
so the first thing i &apos;d like is a competition -- to anybody watching this as a film -- is to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom right .
i become the medium through which the music is being chan@@ ne@@ led , and in the process , when all is right , the music is transformed and so am i .
because this is about 10 dollars of additional hardware if you already have a n@@ inten@@ do wi@@ i .
but i also learned very soon ther@@ ea@@ f@@ ter that jesus also said , and i &apos;m para@@ phra@@ sing , the poor would always be with us .
the truth be told , i was giving out of that place , not out of a genu@@ ine place of hope and excitement to help and of gener@@ osity .
for the first time , actually , in a long time i wanted to meet those individuals , i wanted to meet these entrepreneurs , and see for myself what their lives were actually about .
i just got this impression that the money would work .
because as that happens , i think we can feel free to interact in a way that &apos;s more open , more just and more creative , to engage with each other and to help each other .
so with that in mind , this particular incident has led to the things that i &apos;m working on now .
so that &apos;s what i &apos;m working on now .
there is nothing bigger or older than the universe .
the universe can spon@@ taneously create itself out of nothing .
but we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history .
i &apos;m a designer and an educa@@ tor .
in other words , i look for aliens , and when i tell people that at a cock@@ tail party , they usually look at me with a mil@@ dly incre@@ d@@ ulous look on their face .
that &apos;s a degree of an improvement that would look good on your report card , okay ?
so that &apos;s not so bad . i mean , even with two dozen years , you open up your brow@@ ser and there &apos;s news of a signal , or you get a cup of coffee .
it would change his day , all right ?
these sorts of ideas don &apos;t really have any v@@ ali@@ dity , that you can &apos;t trust the scientists .
this allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a hook to science , because seti involves all kinds of science , obviously biology , obviously astronomy , but also geo@@ logy , also chemistry , various scientific discipl@@ ines all can be presented in the gu@@ ise of , &quot; we &apos;re looking for e.@@ t. &quot;
let me just say , look , my job is a privilege because we &apos;re in a special time .
after i was invited by ted , i did some digging , because that &apos;s what we do , to know about my host .
you find elephants , r@@ hin@@ os , monkeys , pigs , etc .
in a way , this was like the second birth for the child , after 3.@@ 3 million years , but the labor was very long .
what do we actually know about our ancestors ?
what does that tell us ? &quot;
i think it &apos;s important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves .
for example , garbage dis@@ charge , something you would think just simply goes away , but the laws regul@@ ating ship dis@@ charge of garbage actually get wea@@ ker the further you are from shore .
but the sar@@ gas@@ so sea , the same way it aggre@@ gates sar@@ g@@ assu@@ m we@@ ed , actually is pulling in the plastic from throughout the region .
getting closer to shore , where we are , this was in fact taken in the gal@@ apa@@ gos .
at the same time we &apos;re saying , &quot; yes , we need more . we need to move forward . &quot;
k@@ ri@@ st@@ ina g@@ jer@@ de : making law on the high seas
and it &apos;s focus . nor@@ man je@@ wis@@ on said to me , &quot; i think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing . &quot;
why do people succeed ? is it because they &apos;re smart ? or are they just lucky ? neither . analy@@ st richard st. john con@@ den@@ ses years of interviews into an un@@ mi@@ ss@@ able 3@@ -@@ minute sli@@ de@@ show on the real secrets of success .

and this man , arch@@ ie coch@@ rane , is a prisoner of war and a doctor , and he has a problem .
he very carefully and me@@ tic@@ ul@@ ously notes his results in an exercise book .
and you know , with the future billions that we &apos;ve been hearing about , the world is simply far too complex to understand in that way .
there are 100,000 there . it would take you all day .
i realize that &apos;s an ambigu@@ ous statement .
even this problem , too complicated .
it didn &apos;t come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge .
it &apos;s so uncomfortable .
would you like to close down the trial now , or should we wait until we have robust results ? &quot;
but he made mistakes in a good direction .
it will stop because of the end of trade resources .
i find this argument fascinating , as though we can kind of bend the rules of physics to suit our needs .
i accept where we are .
imagine our high@@ ly-@@ tuned , ju@@ st-@@ in-@@ time food industry and our high@@ ly-@@ stre@@ ssed agricultural system failing and supermarket shel@@ ves emp@@ t@@ ying .
think about war .
we need to act like the future depends on it .
and i will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate re@@ boo@@ t looks like .
and we thought we were going to be able to lay these deb@@ ts off on our kids , but , guess what ?
everything else is man@@ dated .
that &apos;s the financial crisis .
graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in .
this should not surprise you , right ?
and all we &apos;ve got is a ro@@ om@@ ba .
and about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and i can , they &apos;ll be able to hear maybe how bats sing , or how whales talk , or how dogs talk , and other types of ton@@ al scales .
i think we &apos;re going to move from a homo sa@@ pi@@ ens into a homo ev@@ olu@@ tis .
and the people thought , &quot; you know , you &apos;re right .
so in every car crash in which at least one person dies , they have information on all of the people .
and so if we look at recent cra@@ shes -- the whole data set is almost 30 years &apos; worth of data -- you won &apos;t see it in the recent cra@@ shes . the new car seats are far , far better . &quot;
so , let me show you what happens .
that &apos;s some more evidence , so in some sense -- i was critici@@ zed by a scientist , who said , &quot; you could never publish a study with an n of 4 , &quot; meaning those four cra@@ shes .
and it turned out that most people wouldn &apos;t come back , because it worked . but every once in a while , there was still a patient convinced that he was sick , and he &apos;d come back . and my dad had a third j@@ ar of pills .
it &apos;s in 5,000 days , all this stuff has come .
so , i was trying to basically make measurements .
so by the year 20@@ 40 , the total processing of this machine will exce@@ ed a total processing power of humanity , in raw bits and stuff . and this is , i think , where ray k@@ ur@@ z@@ we@@ il and others get this little chart saying that we &apos;re going to cross .
right now , it &apos;s not . if you do spre@@ ad@@ sheets and things at work , a word document , they aren &apos;t on the web , but they are going to be . they &apos;re going to be part of this machine .
m@@ clu@@ han was saying , &quot; machines are the exten@@ sions of the human senses . &quot;
so every idea is basically being supported -- or every item , or every n@@ ou@@ n -- is being supported by the entire web .
so we have this database of things .
but it &apos;ll anticip@@ ate what we &apos;re doing , in a good sense .
my journey to coming here today started in 197@@ 4 .
and so i decided to write a book , a me@@ mo@@ ir , about this decade of my life .
all i have to do is hu@@ mb@@ ly follow .
and i organize it . and , well , it &apos;s also a bit different because an architect versus , let &apos;s say , a dance company finally is a negoti@@ ation between one &apos;s private world , one &apos;s concep@@ tual world , the world of ideas , the world of aspi@@ rations , of inventions , with the relationship of the ex@@ ter@@ ior world and all the limitations , the na@@ y@@ sa@@ yers .
and it had to do with the notion of walking a kilome@@ ter , obser@@ ving every kilome@@ ter a particular object of desire , and then plac@@ ing that within this .
and then the broader ideas of c@@ ity-@@ making start having direct influ@@ ences on architecture , on the elements that make up the broader sche@@ me , the buildings themselves , and start gui@@ ding us .
it &apos;s transparent , and it allows you to understand , i think , what is always the most interesting thing in any building , which is the actual construc@@ tional processes that make it .
we could talk about the relationship at a more biological sense of the relationship of building and ground .
they have 22 satellites zi@@ pping around at plus or minus 100 miles , and the site &apos;s in red .
well , then we get to this image .
please , also on the bal@@ con@@ y .
you now , our brain is two to three percent of the body mass , but actually it uses 25 percent of the total energy we use .
you can continue to innov@@ ate and invent .
this is what we are using . &quot;
it &apos;s this brain which makes this ref@@ le@@ x .
then we would generate something all of us would like to have -- a balance between the hunger and the sa@@ ti@@ ation .
and you could look at this art and you could , of course , see the complex social organization of the people who brought it into being .
10,000 square kilometers , tens of thousands of islands fl@@ un@@ g like je@@ w@@ els upon the southern sea .
the third no@@ ble truth said that ignor@@ ance can be overcome .
and then you do the ritual dan@@ ces that empower the cro@@ sses .
they consume more co@@ ca leaves than any human population , half a pound per man , per day .
this little boy will never step outside of the sacred fields that surr@@ ound the men &apos;s hu@@ t for all that time , until he begins his journey of initi@@ ation .
so , their entire year has been cut in half .
anthropo@@ logist wa@@ de da@@ vis m@@ uses on the worldwide web of belief and ritual that makes us human . he shares brea@@ th@@ taking photos and stories of the el@@ der brothers , a group of si@@ erra ne@@ v@@ ada indians whose spiritual practice holds the world in balance .
today , we use a single feed@@ stock , petro@@ le@@ um , to heat our homes , power our cars and make most of the materials you see around you .
the first is selec@@ ting a feed@@ stock , prefer@@ ably something that &apos;s regi@@ onal , that &apos;s in your area , right -- local manufacturing .
it actually takes a little longer . it takes five days .
good afternoon .
now of course , the moment that it does hit the outside environment , and its temperature ri@@ ses by even a fraction of a degree , it immediately turns back into normal matter .
but what seems so slow and gr@@ ac@@ e@@ ful from the outside is really more like chaos inside , because cells control their shape with a skeleton of ri@@ gi@@ d protein fibers , and those fibers are constantly falling apart .
as a test case , i propose we start with american dancers .
when they say to you , &quot; what do you do ? &quot; -- you say , &quot; i &apos;m a statisti@@ ci@@ an . &quot;
you &apos;ve got to think , and i &apos;m going to ask you some questions .
so what you want to do is compare the average number of to@@ sses until we first see head-@@ tail@@ -@@ head with the average number of to@@ sses until we first see head-@@ tail@@ -@@ tail .
if it &apos;s a tail -- well , rather disap@@ poin@@ tedly , you put the glasses away and put the champ@@ ag@@ ne back .
but it turns out that un@@ lo@@ cking the secrets in the information generated by modern experimental technologies , a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisticated -- you &apos;ll be reli@@ ev@@ ed to know that i do something useful in my day job , rather more sophisticated than the head-@@ tail@@ -@@ head story -- but quite sophisticated computer mode@@ lings and mathematical mode@@ lings and modern statisti@@ cal techniques .
so a natural answer is 99 percent .
one explanation is that the person doesn &apos;t have the disease -- that &apos;s overwhel@@ mingly likely , if you pick someone at random -- but the test gets it wrong , which is unlikely .
it might well be that there are environmental factors that we &apos;re not aware of , and it &apos;s pretty likely to be the case that there are genetic factors we &apos;re not aware of .
it has to do with weigh@@ ing up the strength of the other evidence against her and the statisti@@ cal evidence .
that &apos;s what engineers do . &quot;
well , a couple of friends and i figured out how to do this .
there are 10 billion electrical out@@ lets in north america alone .
and now , today i want to tell you my personal observation in the past several years , from that wall .
on the one hand , he wants to satis@@ fy people &apos;s need of a social network , which is very important ; people really love social networking .
and later this year , the ra@@ il minister was sac@@ ked and sent@@ enced to jail for 10 years .
at the comm@@ enting area , &#91; it makes &#93; the chinese wei@@ bo more like facebook , rather than the original twitter .
for example , you can &apos;t post the name of the president , h@@ u j@@ in@@ ta@@ o , and also you can &apos;t post the city of ch@@ ong@@ q@@ ing , the name , and until recently , you can &apos;t search the sur@@ name of top leaders .
so they want an excuse -- public opinion is a very good excuse to pun@@ ish him .
whatever the future is , we should fight against the &#91; cat &#93; .
it &apos;s acou@@ stic vi@@ bra@@ tions in the air , little waves of energy in the air that tic@@ kle our ear@@ drum .
now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss has really evolved in the past 200 years .
girl : hol@@ ly .
so if we had to design a perfect coch@@ lear im@@ plant , what we would try to do is target it to be able to allow music transmission .
coch@@ lear im@@ plant users cannot tell the difference between these instruments .
what that suggests is that , even in the case of hearing loss , the capacity for music remains .
he is now a medical student at y@@ ale university , and he &apos;s con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating a surgical career -- one of the first deaf individuals to consider a career in surgery .
when i look around this ted@@ x@@ am@@ ster@@ dam ven@@ ue , i see a very special audience .
guns are not a part of our lives .
when he a@@ imed , he never missed .
despite the pictures we are shown daily in the news , wars between developed countries are no longer common@@ place .
the armed forces imple@@ ment the state mono@@ po@@ ly on violence .
i hope you will respect my soldiers , this soldier with this gun .
and the interesting thing is that if you change the sequence , you change the three-dimensional folding .
we want to be able to build technological arti@@ facts that are maybe good for the world . we want to learn how to build biological arti@@ facts , like people and whales and trees .
and then what happens ?
women are much more in balance because they don &apos;t have that idea that they &apos;re going to be able to do 100 pul@@ l-@@ ups .
but we do have the potential to overcome disease and poverty , and i &apos;m going to talk about those issues , if we have the will .
i &apos;m going to show you just a few examples of how per@@ va@@ sive this phenomena is .
there &apos;s a basic , profound acceler@@ ation of this evolutionary process .
i mean , you &apos;d think this is the result of some tab@@ le@@ top experiment , but this is the result of worldwide cha@@ otic behavior -- countries ac@@ c@@ using each other of du@@ mping products , i@@ po@@ s , ban@@ k@@ rup@@ t@@ cies , marketing programs .
we &apos;re understanding the software programs that make our body run .
these are some designs from eric dre@@ x@@ ler &apos;s book -- which we &apos;re now showing are fea@@ sible with super-@@ computing si@@ mu@@ lations , where actually there are scientists building mole@@ cu@@ le-@@ scale robots .
dou@@ g ho@@ f@@ st@@ ad@@ ter won@@ ders , well , maybe our intelligence just isn &apos;t great enough to understand our intelligence , and if we were smarter , well , then our brains would be that much more complicated , and we &apos;d never catch up to it .
computers will combine the subtle pan@@ -@@ recognition powers of human intelligence with ways in which machines are already super@@ ior , in terms of doing analy@@ tic thinking , rememb@@ ering billions of facts accur@@ ately .
inventor , entrepreneur and vi@@ sion@@ ary ray k@@ ur@@ z@@ we@@ il explains in abundant , gr@@ ounded detail why , by the 20@@ 20s , we will have rever@@ se-@@ engineered the human brain and nan@@ ob@@ ots will be operating your consciousness .
so like fo@@ x mul@@ der on &quot; x-@@ files , &quot; who wants to believe in u@@ fo@@ s ? well , we all do , and the reason for that is because we have a belief engine in our brains .
you &apos;ve been taken out of the gene pool .
because there &apos;s nothing in this . well , alle@@ ge@@ dly there &apos;s nothing .
an increase of dopamine caused subjects to see more patterns than those that did not receive the dopamine .
the other one also , but maybe too many patterns .
well here &apos;s the late , great jer@@ ry and@@ rus &apos; &quot; impossible cr@@ ate &quot; illusion in 3d , in which jer@@ ry is standing inside the impossible cr@@ ate .
especially when they &apos;re upside down , you &apos;re engaging that general facial recognition software there .
some con@@ spir@@ acies really are true .
and this is test on some li@@ p bal@@ ms that we have over here .
i love trees , and i &apos;m very lucky , because we live near a wonderful ar@@ bo@@ re@@ tum , and sun@@ days , usually , i &apos;d go there with my wife and now , with my four@@ -year-old , and we &apos;d climb in the trees , we &apos;d play hide and seek .
but later the government soldiers began mi@@ stre@@ ating us a lot .
but this , surely , whoever that man is , whatever he &apos;s done , this is cru@@ el and unusual punishment .
so the question is , how do they deal with this material ?
what we &apos;re going to do now is sha@@ de the sun with a board and then move the sun with a mirror to a completely different position .
every now and then , when they climb on top of the ball , they wi@@ pe their face .
so this is called sti@@ l@@ ting . it &apos;s a thermal behavior that you and i do if we cross the beach , we jump onto a to@@ wel , somebody has this to@@ wel -- &quot; sorry , i &apos;ve jumped onto your to@@ wel . &quot; -- and then you scu@@ t@@ tle across onto somebody else &apos;s to@@ wel , and that way you don &apos;t burn your feet .
so here &apos;s our c@@ un@@ ning experim@@ enter .
it &apos;s about an 8@@ -@@ foot@@ -@@ long tube of metal , it &apos;s got a hundred or so holes on top , on that side is the speaker , and here is some lab tu@@ bing , and it &apos;s connected to this tank of pro@@ pan@@ e .
you see the sk@@ aters often trick in this direction . the obstacles are easier .
sometimes you get a little star app@@ la@@ use , and then i think even bill gates takes a nervous breath , and the talk begins .
but he was cred@@ ited with co@@ ining the phrase , &quot; because it &apos;s there . &quot;
i didn &apos;t see anyone else . we took this photo next to the helicopter .
it is , argu@@ ably , the most aud@@ acious endea@@ vor of that ed@@ war@@ dian golden age of exploration , and it seemed to me high time , given everything we have figured out in the century since from sc@@ ur@@ vy to solar panels , that it was high time someone had a go at fin@@ ishing the job .
and so therefore , the entire purpose of a v@@ c pitch is to convince them that you are the entrepreneur in whom they are going to invest their money and make a lot of money in return .
and now along with that , along with the experience of starting an enterprise , or running something -- and it doesn &apos;t have to be a business .
there &apos;s never been an angel@@ - or a ven@@ tu@@ re-@@ funded company where bad things didn &apos;t happen .
and then from there , you &apos;ve got to take them on a very solid , stea@@ dy , upward path , right from beginning to end .
&quot; we have no competition . there &apos;s nobody else who &apos;s ever made a wi@@ d@@ get like this . &quot;
you &apos;re focusing on him ! this is steve jobs .
you do that , you give me your quick 15@@ -@@ second or 30-@@ second in@@ tr@@ o , grab my attention .
there has never been a company that doesn &apos;t have competition .
this is that rocket going up .
number three : the hand@@ outs you give are not your presentation .
you can use it at ted .
this is the most successful order on the planet by far .
so when i click on &quot; sym@@ pa@@ thetic magic , &quot; i get sym@@ pa@@ thetic magic and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o dol@@ ls .
when i click on y@@ ur@@ i g@@ ag@@ ar@@ in &apos;s page , i get this guy who was surprisingly short in st@@ ature , huge in hero@@ ism .
by revolution , i mean a dra@@ stic and far-@@ reaching change in the way we think and behave -- the way we think and the way we behave .
last .
because it &apos;s shown the way we apply , generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context , which told us what in commun@@ ism ?
it &apos;s a cra@@ p system .
and you can say , &quot; that &apos;s ridiculous , steve . what a dumb idea .
the more you play , the bigger the brains there are .
it &apos;s not fiction , it &apos;s not story tal@@ es , it &apos;s not ma@@ ke-@@ believe ; it &apos;s cold , hard science .
for example , it stimul@@ ates creativity .
one , play is universal .
i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s mountain bi@@ king or reading a book or playing a game .
un@@ acceptable . ne@@ pri@@ em@@ li@@ v .
all of these things were made during the last 75 years .
my work actually took me through many countries , and showed me a great part of the world .
however , everybody in the factory spent his time at the art department .
so i was arrested quite early in stal@@ in &apos;s pur@@ ges , and spent 16 months in a russian prison .
this was bad ! man , i was -- i cou@@ gh . i was sick .
idea about women .
obviously a really profound moment , and it changed our lives in many ways .
we really felt like what we went in expecting had nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing , and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight .
but what i felt towards the child at that moment was deep affe@@ ction , but nothing like what i feel for him now , five years later .
you can &apos;t talk about how lonely having a baby can be .
and we were grateful that i was able to get pregnant , and i soon learned that we were having a boy , and then when i was five months , we learned that we had lost our child .
and i got about two-thirds of the way through , and there was a chart on the right-hand side -- on the right-hand page -- that we &apos;ve labeled here &quot; the most terrifying chart imag@@ in@@ able for a new parent . &quot;
a@@ v : yeah , and then you have your first child , and then you really re@@ sub@@ mit yourself to these high@@ s and lows -- the high@@ s being the first steps , the first smile , your child reading to you for the first time -- the lows being , our house , any time from six to seven every night .
so the point of all this for us today is not just hopefully honest@@ y for the sake of honest@@ y , but a hope that by being more honest and can@@ did about these experiences , that we can all collectively bend that happiness ba@@ sel@@ ine up a little bit .
and , you know , it &apos;s a thing your piano teacher teaches you , but we never had a science behind these kinds of things .
and then you heard the original .
your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement , you know .
you want to hear it in different rooms and whatever .

and when people aren &apos;t allowed to be useful , they soon think that they &apos;re useless .
a few of these . this is a@@ til@@ la the h@@ en .
we know our societies have to radically change .
and some are quite structural , like social impact bon@@ ds where you raise money to invest in diver@@ ting teenagers from crime or helping old people keep out of hospital , and you get paid back according to how successful your projects are .
then mon@@ archy had seen off its big challeng@@ er , mass democracy , which was seen as a well-@@ inten@@ tioned but do@@ om@@ ed experiment , just as capitalism has seen off soci@@ alism .
despite all of these simil@@ arities , we see huge differences in savings behavior .
why ? because i have to consider that and i have to modi@@ fy what i &apos;m saying to say , &quot; it will rain , &quot; or &quot; it &apos;s going to rain . &quot;
well , what i did with that was to access the lingu@@ istics literature .

it &apos;s current pleasure in exchange for future pain .
of course , from their grandparents and even their great-@@ grandparents .

we need one today more than ever .

it turned out that giving the planes to the museum was worth much more than the debt , so for five years , six years , i only had to pay one third income tax .

this delu@@ sion is a kind of prison for us , restri@@ cting us to our personal desi@@ res and to affe@@ ction for a few per@@ sons nearest to us .
and he had a lu@@ mp of iron .
well , at least i can clean this w@@ ound and wash it . &quot;
and ma@@ it@@ re@@ ya says , &quot; i was with you . who do you think was making needles and making ne@@ sts and dri@@ pping on rocks for you , mi@@ ster dense ? &quot;
i got mad . brothers can fight . parents and children can fight .
the mother is the model of all al@@ tru@@ ism for human beings , in spiritual traditions .
and so you see beings in their potential happiness .
and this is where you feel real compassion for them .
so , practice compassion , read the charter , disse@@ minate it and develop it within yourself .
but there &apos;s another class of simple things , which are also very important .
we have a lot of interesting information about what complexity is .
all of us , to some extent , study this thing called a bill gates .
now , if you like to represent this zero and one of binary , you need a device .
all right , let me then finish off with four general state@@ ments , an example and two a@@ ph@@ or@@ isms .
and i don &apos;t want to spend your time in going through the details , but in the lower right-hand corner , you see an example of the kind of thing that we have .
but it does make a point -- which is one which , in a sense , differenti@@ ates the real world of people who make things , and the world of people who think about things , which is , there is an intellectual mer@@ it to asking : how do we make things as simple as we can , as cheap as we can , as functional as we can and as freely inter@@ connect@@ able as we can ?
so , they got the fra@@ mes from these big bi@@ kes , put them together with the ge@@ ars from the rac@@ ing bi@@ kes , got the bra@@ kes from motor@@ cycles , and sort of mixed and matched various ingredients .
the ideas are coming back from the consumers , and they &apos;re often ahead of the producers .
that sounds like a winner ; we &apos;ll go with it . &quot;
well , just imagine a world , for the moment , divided into two camps .
or the op@@ -@@ ed page , where if they knew the editor -- had been to school with him , sle@@ pt with his wife -- they could write an article for the op@@ -@@ ed page .
and i was having dinner with this guy called ti@@ mo@@ thy cha@@ n .
if you &apos;re a games company , and you &apos;ve got a million players in your game , you only need one percent of them to be co-@@ develo@@ pers , contribu@@ ting ideas , and you &apos;ve got a development workforce of 10,000 people .
this was a mother &apos;s day gift .
hundreds of re@@ mi@@ xes came back -- lots of different attemp@@ ts .
and this is it , right , to feel and be felt .
recording : okay , here &apos;s something .
and he said , &quot; i &apos;m dressed as bat@@ man to hide my identity . &quot;
one person sent me a very detailed description ; the other person didn &apos;t .
right now , it feels like i forgot to turn the light on and things that looked so good yesterday are now sha@@ des of gray and it seems like the world is spinning while i &apos;m standing still or maybe i am spinning i can &apos;t tell and then you say hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe and now the words sing hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe now everybody sin@@ gs hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe thank you .
so there is the pattern that every one of them had , but they all were a little different too .
but then my mother said to me , &quot; i hear you &apos;ve been going around talking about psychop@@ ath@@ ic kil@@ lers .
but our grand@@ kids are going to be kind of concerned here .
and we re-@@ create the conditions that were present less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe began up to 600 million times a second inside that detector -- immense numbers .
imagine a s@@ now@@ fla@@ ke in your hand , and you look at it , and it &apos;s an incredibly complicated , beautiful object . but as you heat it up , it &apos;ll melt into a pool of water , and you would be able to see that , actually , it was just made of h@@ 20 , water .
but what he meant was that what we &apos;ve done , really , is st@@ amp collect there .
so all the ex@@ quis@@ itely detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation wouldn &apos;t be possible without an extra bit .
so that &apos;s one thing .
in about the first billi@@ on@@ th of a second or so , the higgs field kicked in , and the quar@@ ks and the glu@@ ons and the electrons that make us up got mass .
and i &apos;m certainly looking forward with immense excitement to it being turned on .
so from pa@@ pu@@ a new gu@@ ine@@ a to hollywood all the way to modern art in beijing , we smile often , and you smile to express joy and satisfaction .
smiling can help reduce the level of stre@@ ss-@@ enhan@@ cing hor@@ mones like cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l , ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine and dopamine , increase the level of mo@@ o@@ d-@@ enhan@@ cing hor@@ mones like end@@ or@@ ph@@ in and reduce overall blood pressure .
but i told him no , i &apos;m sorry , compromise in colors is gray , and we have enough gray to last us a lifetime .
and this was not a mis@@ placed feeling .
we put the citizen first , and not the cl@@ er@@ ks .
ef@@ har@@ is@@ to and k@@ al@@ ini@@ h@@ ta .
people that were hungry and hur@@ ting were sign@@ aling their di@@ stress , were sign@@ aling their need for help .
technology is transforma@@ tional .
and not only is it empower@@ ing to the communities , but really importantly , this information stays in the community where it is needed to formul@@ ate long-term health poli@@ ces .
half the city was dark because of a power cut , and i was living on the dark side .
but the story is not about these chapters .
your last job , your dinner reser@@ vations from last year , your former friends , lie on a flat plain with today &apos;s friends , because the internet also archi@@ ves , and it war@@ ps the past .
for us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our wa@@ king moments in it , the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simul@@ taneous .
i wanted to learn to cook , and she kept me in the kitchen , cutting , cu@@ bing and ch@@ op@@ ping for a whole month .

and then the next planting season , when they san@@ g the dir@@ ge , they would remove as many names of the dead that equ@@ aled as many people that were born .
i cri@@ ed for a very long time .
he was obsessed .
there are some of you in this room , amazing people , who offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity .
if you take a close@@ -up of those , they look like this .
and if it is -- and particularly given the fact that we came very close to extinction .
so about 10,000 years ago by the black sea , we had one mutation in one gene which led to blue eyes .
three different options .
you can tag them with proteins that light up when you light them .
but one question you might want to ask is , are we seeing a rapid evolution of the brain and of how we process data ?
throughout human evolution , multiple versions of humans co-@@ existed . could we be mid-@@ up@@ grade now ? at ted@@ x@@ summit , ju@@ an enri@@ que@@ z swee@@ ps across time and space to bring us to the present moment -- and shows how technology is reve@@ aling evidence that suggests rapid evolution may be under way .
and when that happens there &apos;s moment that causes this robot to roll .
you can send them inside buildings like this as first respon@@ ders to look for in@@ tru@@ ders , maybe look for bio@@ chemical lea@@ ks , ga@@ se@@ ous lea@@ ks .
so the robot is obviously capable of execu@@ ting any curve trajectory .
so when we have a robot which is surrounded by neighbors -- and let &apos;s look at robot i and robot j -- what we want the robots to do is to monitor the separation between them as they fly in formation .
this is work done by qu@@ enti@@ n lin@@ d@@ sey who &apos;s a graduate student .
and that &apos;s how it popu@@ l@@ ates this map .
we &apos;re very co-@@ evolved , because we depend on bees for pollin@@ ation and , even more recently , as an economic commodity .
there &apos;s a counter@@ intuitive trend that we noticed in these numbers . so let &apos;s look at the first metric here , over@@ w@@ inter@@ ing survival .
it &apos;s 196@@ 8 , and we &apos;re pretty much covering asia .
it &apos;s like , &quot; u@@ gh , &quot; so that &apos;s what we do .
i would like to encourage you to open your mind .
one is a supermarket standard : white bread , pre-@@ pack@@ aged , which i &apos;m told is called a wonder@@ bread .
but we have , somehow , in the course of the last few centuries , or even decades , started to cultiv@@ ate an image of a my@@ th@@ ical , rural agricultural past .
and this is true , as you can see , for all countries , including the so-called developing countries .
the costs have been tremendous -- water pollution , all the things you know about , destruction of our habit@@ ats .
in fact we do not want this poor woman to work the land like this .
but yes there are some solutions .
i want to see fish pon@@ ds in parking lots and base@@ ments .
we need to make them proud of being a farmer because they allow us to survive .
living with a physical disability isn &apos;t easy anywhere in the world , but if you live in a country like the united states , there &apos;s certain app@@ ur@@ ten@@ ances available to you that do make life easier .
it &apos;s the person that &apos;s sli@@ ding his hands up and down the le@@ vers , so the mechanism itself can be very simple and com@@ posed of bicycle parts you can get anywhere in the world .
and then you can also engage the end user in the design process , and not just ask him what he needs , but ask him how he thinks it can be achieved .
what my purpose of the talk today really is , is to sort of inde@@ li@@ bly s@@ car your minds with these char@@ is@@ matic and maj@@ estic creatures .
and they didn &apos;t kill it . they called us to catch it .
and now the king co@@ bra is a new one .
i mean , just incredible to see bun@@ ches of gh@@ ari@@ al bas@@ king on the river again .
and , you know , once a tox@@ in is in the food chain everything is affected , including us .
so , people talk about political will .
r@@ w : yes , this is actually the first time anyone of us knew about it , for one thing .
and it &apos;s not a diet .
now i thought , you know , if we just did good science , that would change medical practice . but , that was a little nai@@ ve .
and yet , look at the number of pre@@ scrip@@ tions that are being sold .
but the problem is , you get hungry , so it &apos;s hard to keep it off .
it also helps reduce the risk of the most common cancers like breast , prostate and col@@ on cancer .
when we looked at their p@@ sa levels -- which is a mar@@ ker for prostate cancer -- they got worse in the control group , but they actually got better in the experimental group , and these differences were highly significant .
it was a random@@ ized control study published in the lan@@ ce@@ t .
b@@ p : i was born old .
the human form , in particular the human head , has been considered the holy gra@@ il of our industry .
and so , in 2004 , they com@@ mission@@ ed us to do a screen test of benjamin .
and we also needed to make sure that we could take bra@@ d &apos;s idi@@ o@@ syn@@ cra@@ si@@ es , his little tics , the little sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties that make him who he is and have that translate through our process so that it appears in benjamin on the screen .
we started to look out in other fields .
this is when we &apos;re like , &quot; ok , we &apos;re going to be ok , this is actually going to work . &quot;
and because the life cast , or the bust -- the ma@@ qu@@ et@@ te -- of benjamin was made from bra@@ d , we could trans@@ pose the data of bra@@ d at 4@@ 4 onto bra@@ d at 8@@ 7 .
and then this is what we called the &quot; dead head , &quot; no reference to jer@@ ry gar@@ cia .
so , effectively we created a digital puppe@@ t that bra@@ d pit@@ t could operate with his own face .
and the bear cu@@ bs were being harve@@ sted from across the country and being sold and tra@@ ded .
and then it started , there was no turning back after that .
and the beautiful bears can of course live in the wild again .
we were in the desert , in w@@ ad@@ i ru@@ m , in a small je@@ ep .
so as we talked , richard and i , i said , &quot; you know , maybe i should bring a camel .
but not a big -- for instance , in ze@@ br@@ as , they have a huge ear that &apos;s very mobile , so they can actually turn them both around .
you can actually see , right here , it will vibr@@ ate .
well , if poor old su@@ ki is in search of a mate , what would su@@ ki do to find the perfect mate ?
i &apos;m built to last .
and i think when you look at the animal kingdom , that is one of the most remarkable things .
when i was poet lau@@ re@@ ate , there i go again -- i can &apos;t help it , it &apos;s true -- i created a poetry channel on del@@ ta air@@ lines that la@@ sted for a couple of years .
some days i put the people in their places at the table , bend their legs at the kne@@ es , if they come with that feature , and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs .
the poem that &apos;s coming up is based on him trying to tell me a little something about a domestic point of e@@ ti@@ qu@@ et@@ te in country living that i had a very hard time , at first , processing .
i just have time to read a more recent poem to you .
and so it makes you wonder , what would happen if we hadn &apos;t ta@@ sted the fruit of knowledge , so to speak , and what kind of morality would we have ?
the wol@@ f is , after all , a very cooperative animal .
he takes basically everything .
and so what we do in the next step is we release one elephant before the other , and that elephant needs to be smart enough to stay there and wait and not pull at the rope -- because if he pulls at the rope , it disappears and the whole test is over .
humans ya@@ wn when others ya@@ wn .
in this case , we put two chimpanzees si@@ de-@@ by-@@ side .
and so we found that the chimpanzees do care about the well-being of somebody else -- especially , these are other members of their own group .
and that &apos;s what she does .
so let &apos;s watch a movement happen , start to finish , in under three minutes and disse@@ ct some lessons from it .
so first , if you are the type , like the shir@@ tless dancing guy that is standing alone , remember the importance of nur@@ turing your first few follo@@ wers as equ@@ als so it &apos;s clearly about the movement , not you .
but i decided to learn about the bible and my heritage by actually diving in and trying to live it and immer@@ se myself in it .
and my im@@ mu@@ no@@ logist told me that i should also wi@@ pe down all of the remote controls and i@@ phones in my house , because those are just or@@ gies of ger@@ ms .
without the sex part .
but i think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food .
so what we found was , when try@@ p@@ top@@ han was low , people were more likely to take reven@@ ge when they &apos;re treated un@@ fairly .
but i didn &apos;t find any .
sure , it is involved in positive emotions like love and compassion , but it &apos;s also involved in tons of other processes , like memory , language , attention , even anger , disgust and pain .
there &apos;s just one problem .
and perhaps one ar@@ che@@ ologist becomes an instant celebrity when she disco@@ vers -- buried in the hills somewhere in north america -- massive versions of these same symbols .
or maybe that big ?
so as i showed you , they &apos;re usually found on these seals that are very , very tiny .
now there &apos;s several thoughts . there &apos;s e@@ . it could be i@@ . it could be a , but certainly not b , c or d , right ?
we found that the indus script actually falls within the range of the lingu@@ istic scrip@@ ts .
that &apos;s our next big challenge .
today , we can write a word such as ted in egyp@@ tian hi@@ ero@@ g@@ ly@@ ph@@ ics and in cu@@ nei@@ form script , because both of these were deci@@ ph@@ ered in the 19th century .
and this is the space probe cas@@ sin@@ i pi@@ rou@@ e@@ tting through the ice rings of saturn .
using the very first telephone , wat@@ son was in fact di@@ aled into the hea@@ ven@@ s .
a mysterious persist@@ ent noise was disrup@@ ting their research .
and as soon as they had laid all these , all their big stack of these jewel@@ ed paras@@ ols that they used to carry in ancient india , he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant plan@@ et@@ arium , the wonder of the universe . everyone looked in that , and they saw in there the total inter@@ connec@@ ted@@ ness of all life in all universes .
because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone , each of us , and everyone else is different , then that puts us in an impossible situation , doesn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s really too boring whether you feel like this or like that , or what , you know -- and the more you focus on how you feel , by the way , the worse it gets .
look at that beautiful thing chi@@ h@@ o showed us . she scared us with the la@@ va man .
this is bir@@ han , who was the ethiop@@ ian girl who launched live aid in the 1980s , 15 minutes away from death when she was resc@@ u@@ ed , and that picture of her being resc@@ u@@ ed is one that went round the world .
but it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful .
amy w@@ ine@@ house said , &quot; nelson mandela and i have a lot in common .
i have just been talking to the president of si@@ erra le@@ one .
so we have got to create in this world also institutions for peace@@ keeping and humanitarian aid , but also for re@@ construction and security for some of the confli@@ ct@@ -@@ ri@@ dden states of the world .
so you go to the literature .
the foot is distributed along the whole leg .
not just with the traditional foot , but also the leg , and even of the body .
and where they have a problem with this kind of mesh , because they don &apos;t have sp@@ ines .
it &apos;s a secret . the animal effectively climb@@ s by sli@@ pping and look -- and doing , actually , terribly , with respect to grab@@ bing on the surface .
watch what happens when the foot goes onto your sandwich .
we discovered they work by inter@@ molecular forces alone .
and here it is coming up at you , in its first steps up a wall .
so there &apos;s a clear message : whether you care about a fundamental , basic research of really interesting , bizarre , wonderful animals , or you want to build a sear@@ ch@@ -and-@@ rescue robot that can help you in an earthquake , or to save someone in a fire , or you care about medicine , we must preserve nature &apos;s designs .
this is a cal@@ f in cap@@ tivity making an im@@ itation if you hum@@ med this tune to your dog or cat and it hum@@ med it back to you , you ought to be pretty surprised .
as you can see at the top here , they share an up@@ -@@ swe@@ ep , like &quot; woo@@ p , woo@@ p , woo@@ p . &quot;
notice how few barriers there are to movement across all of the oceans compared to land .
hu@@ mp@@ backs , when they develop the ability to sing this song , they &apos;re listening to other whales and modi@@ fying what they sing based on what they &apos;re hearing , just like song birds or the dolphin whist@@ les i described .
but you can still hear that fa@@ int call .
i &apos;ll describe a couple strategies .
endangered whales are killed every year by ship colli@@ sion , and it &apos;s very important to try to reduce this .
at the same time , we need to be really creative in thinking of solutions to be able to help reduce these problems .
first , it enables you to experience the universe : the worldwide telescope , for me , is a kind of magic carpet that lets you navigate through the universe where you want to go .
it &apos;ll be a free download -- thank you , cra@@ ig mun@@ die -- and it &apos;ll be available at the website world@@ wide@@ tele@@ sco@@ pe@@ .org , which is something new .
it &apos;s a social awk@@ war@@ dness like you &apos;re a stran@@ ger in a foreign land .
that means they &apos;re totally out of syn@@ c in traditional classes , which are analo@@ g , static , inter@@ actively passive .
we have so much technology nowadays that these inter@@ faces should start con@@ forming to us .
this kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it , and i &apos;m really looking forward to interacting with all you guys over the next few days and seeing how it can apply to your respe@@ ctive fields .
corruption ? poverty ? or is it something else ?
we want to go on with our daily life even though we are not living under normal circumstances .
recently -- this is a sensitive figure -- 35 public ly@@ n@@ ch@@ ings have been recorded so far in 2010 in mexico .
with a thousand ju@@ li@@ á@@ ns working together , mexico would be a very different country .
this is a call so that every single thing we love about mexico -- the festiv@@ als , the markets , the restaurants , the can@@ tin@@ as , the te@@ qu@@ ila , the mari@@ ac@@ his , the seren@@ ades , the pos@@ ad@@ as , el gri@@ to , the day of the dead , san mi@@ gu@@ el , the joy , the passion for life , the fight and everything it means to be m@@ exi@@ can -- doesn &apos;t disappear from this world .
thanks . thank you . now , ju@@ ggling can be a lot of fun ; play with skill and play with space , play with rhythm .
or you can go back and change the height . now , skill .
bring it back up .
finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
why the hell should i learn this ? ok ?
and what do you dedi@@ cate it to , in exploring a particular thing ?
i app@@ r@@ enti@@ ced with a car@@ pen@@ ter and learned about pl@@ umb , square and level .
and the latest thing that i &apos;m working on -- -- is something really -- i don &apos;t know what it is yet .
and so thinking back , i was thinking those of us in silicon valley were really focused on products or objects -- certainly technological objects .
i have a few of them -- they &apos;re no more than a minute or a minu@@ te@@ -and-@@ a-half ap@@ i@@ e@@ ce -- but i thought you might be interested in seeing some of our work over the last year , and how it respon@@ ds in video .
then when you ex@@ it the ima@@ x the@@ at@@ re on the fourth floor -- mostly teenagers coming out of there -- there &apos;s this big open space that has these tables in it that have interactive games which are quite fun , also designed by dur@@ re@@ ll &#91; bi@@ shop &#93; and andrew &#91; hi@@ r@@ ni@@ ak &#93; of it@@ ch .
and of course : a ham@@ mo@@ ck for your afternoon na@@ p that stret@@ ches across your cu@@ bic@@ le .
you watch the video with super@@ im@@ posed graphics that indi@@ cate your depth and compas@@ s heading .
there is more of it than you think , actually .
a photo is not enough . &quot;
the laws of physics : invisible , e@@ ternal , om@@ ni@@ present , all-@@ powerful .
and i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and he said , &quot; why can &apos;t i ? &quot;
i find that extraordinary , not to be able to see light , not to be able to see darkness .
&quot; why are we here ? &quot; and &quot; what should we do about it while we are ?
this is extremely practical , but not so awesome .
so you have five million , that is , five million authors and five million pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs is a massive law@@ suit .
two ro@@ ws from this table of two billion ent@@ ries .
and it turns out that we can measure that very precisely .
so that &apos;s sort of what we expect .
we have to make this available for people . &quot;
and when that happens , that will transform the way we have to understand our past , our present and human culture .
but that &apos;s not all .
this is not trivial .
or just try this one on for size .
and if we can teach listening in our schools , we can take our listening off that sli@@ p@@ per@@ y slo@@ pe to that dangerous , scary world that i talked about and move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time -- or at least capable of doing it .
and meanwhile , i was t@@ our@@ ing locally and playing in night@@ clubs with my band , the dre@@ s@@ den dol@@ ls .
i &apos;ve always been with my band or my crew .
and this starts happening all the time .
this is my kic@@ k@@ star@@ ter bac@@ ker party in berlin .
well let me tell you , in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year , because the arab spring is still spreading , the euro@@ zone has collapsed ... what else ?
actually , that photo was pa@@ sted in a police station , and what you see on the ground are id cards of all the photos of people being trac@@ ked by the police .
kids just make photos in a class , the teacher recei@@ ves them , they paste them on the school .
i do two things : i design mobile computers and i study brains .
i thought the word framework was great .
one is -- the most basic one is -- people like to know things .
and it &apos;s a real shame . now why has this come about ?
and finally , some people say , well , you know , i don &apos;t feel like a bunch of cells , you know . i &apos;m conscious .
evolution &apos;s the same thing . we taught our kids , well , the bible says , you know , god created all these species , cats are cats , dogs are dogs , people are people , plants are plants , they don &apos;t change .
and that somehow , prediction leads to intelligent behavior .
and in the future , when it sees something similar to that again , so in a similar environment , or the exact same environment , it &apos;ll play it back . it &apos;ll start playing it back .
door , door , door , you know , color , you know what i &apos;m saying .
then , if in that framework , you take a bunch of theore@@ ticians .
no doubt that it &apos;s going to happen , in my mind .
i &apos;m actually here to make a challenge to people .
just that little bit of money , which to me , i wish it was in my bank account -- it &apos;s not , but ...
i spoke with a@@ un@@ g sun su@@ u k@@ y@@ i a couple of days ago .
but if they were together planting trees for the environment , it was okay -- creativity .
but it was the actions , together , of all of us that brought about that change .
today , in sweden and other rich countries , people are using so many different machines .
but when i lecture to environ@@ ment@@ ally-@@ concerned students , they tell me , &quot; no , everybody in the world cannot have cars and washing machines . &quot;
second , economic growth .
it &apos;s a real challenge in the future .
i would like to tell you a story connecting the no@@ tori@@ ous privacy incident invol@@ ving adam and eve , and the remarkable shift in the boundaries between public and private which has occurred in the past 10 years .
do you see where i &apos;m going with this ?
di@@ scri@@ mination was happening through social media for equally sk@@ illed candidates .
we repeated the experiment with the same two groups , this time adding a del@@ ay between the time we told subjects how we would use their data and the time we actually started answer@@ ing the questions .
they become aware . they achieve autonomy .
i once -- this was years ago -- i saw ted ken@@ ne@@ dy and dan qua@@ y@@ le meet in the well of the sen@@ ate .
and it &apos;s led to a view of human nature that we &apos;re rational individuals who respond in straightforward ways to incentives , and it &apos;s led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the assumptions of physics to measure how human behavior is .
they have kids of their own , and they &apos;ve achieved a genetic miracle by mar@@ rying beautiful people , so their grand@@ mom@@ s look like ger@@ tru@@ de stein , their daughters looks like hal@@ le berry -- i don &apos;t know how they &apos;ve done that .
people with stro@@ kes and le@@ sions in the emo@@ tion-@@ processing parts of the brain are not super smart , they &apos;re actually sometimes quite help@@ less .
but i think this research shows that the british enlighten@@ ment , or the scot@@ tish enlighten@@ ment , with david hu@@ me , adam smith , actually had a better handle on who we are -- that reason is often weak , our senti@@ ments are strong , and our senti@@ ments are often tru@@ st@@ worthy .
nine@@ ty-@@ six percent of college students say they have abo@@ ve-@@ average social skills .
but this is the source of innovation .
thank you .
and i tell you stories from there .
we are living among those men : they &apos;re our brothers , fathers , un@@ cles , cou@@ sins , all around us .
she works for a very big company , a work@@ shop in hy@@ der@@ ab@@ ad , making furnit@@ ures .
it &apos;s very fashi@@ on@@ able to talk about human tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king , in this fantastic a-@@ c hall .
i &apos;m asking you , for these children , whose faces you see , they &apos;re no more .
just to let you know , i do not have a lex@@ ic@@ o@@ graphical whist@@ le .
computers ! what about computers ?
so -- -- now , when you think about this , what we have here is a ham but@@ t problem .
no . there will still be paper dic@@ tion@@ aries .
you didn &apos;t break it . it &apos;s just in a new position , and that new position can be just as beautiful .
if we think of the dictionary as being the map of the english language , these bright spots are what we know about , and the dark spots are where we are in the dark .
because i &apos;m going to the internet , which is where everybody goes .
and we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language -- we can make it be the whole language .
the date was february 2000 .
we talk about this a lot , and i thought about trying to give an example of this . so , just one example : ma@@ da@@ me de ga@@ ul@@ le , the wife of the french president , was fam@@ ously asked once , &quot; what do you most desire ? &quot;
jeff be@@ z@@ os kin@@ dly remar@@ ked to me , &quot; chris , ted is a really great conference .
i &apos;m in this for the long run , and i would be great@@ ly honored and excited if you &apos;ll come on this journey with me .
for one thing , gps doesn &apos;t work in@@ doors , and for another , they don &apos;t make devices quite this small , especially when those devices have to rel@@ ay their measurements back over a network .
in fact , as i looked into her case , i discovered to my surprise that it &apos;s not clearly illegal for you or me to put a tracking device on someone else &apos;s car .
so let me show you how this works .
so something felt very wrong about the world .
we call ourselves por@@ s and ra@@ o , and we live and work in india .
this is a video prototype .
but as soon as they passed by , it would start to climb up the wall in jer@@ ky fashion .
and once a creature po@@ ps into our minds , it &apos;s almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move .
but we move to cities , toward the bright lights , and one of the things that is there that we want , besides jobs , is electricity .
like@@ wise , with solar , especially here in california , we &apos;re discovering that the 80 solar farm sche@@ mes that are going forward want to basically bul@@ l@@ do@@ ze 1,000 square miles of southern california desert .
so arguing against , a man who &apos;s been at the nit@@ ty , gr@@ it@@ ty heart of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years .
and this doesn &apos;t even account for the footprint on the ground .
over the ocean , it &apos;s not even land .
nuclear , the time la@@ g alone will allow the arctic to melt and other places to melt more .
solving the world &apos;s problems can be done , if you really put your mind to it and use clean , renewable energy .
thank you .
so each of you has really just a couple sentences -- 30 seconds each to sum up .
sha@@ me@@ less . sha@@ me@@ less . sha@@ me@@ less .
we explore for three reasons , the wea@@ ke@@ st of which is curiosity .
the shu@@ t@@ tle is co@@ sting a billion dollars a launch .
100 bucks . that &apos;s the pri@@ ce@@ -@@ improvement curve that -- we need some break@@ through@@ s in physics along the way , i &apos;ll grant you that .
we went -- i went to 100 , 200 ce@@ os , c@@ mo@@ s .
when you want the taste that won &apos;t weigh you down , the only way to go is up .
then , you &apos;ve got to , you know , face potential public ridi@@ cule of -- that &apos;s a crazy idea , it &apos;ll never work .
nature &apos;s main process of creation , mor@@ pho@@ gen@@ esis , is the spl@@ itting of one cell into two cells .
i designed the process that generated the form .
and unlike traditional architecture , it &apos;s a single process that creates both the overall form and the microscopic surface detail .
it took me several months to design the column , but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces .
there &apos;s that di@@ p there for the 19@@ 18 flu .
you we@@ ed down through various steps that cause many of these to fail .
it &apos;s called hu@@ t@@ ch@@ in@@ son@@ -@@ gil@@ ford pro@@ g@@ eria , and it is the most dramatic form of pre@@ mature aging .
so i just want to say a couple more things about that particular story , and then try to gener@@ alize how could we have stories of success all over the place for these diseases , as sam says , these 4,000 that are waiting for answers .
you probably know , if you &apos;ve been paying attention to some of the science literature that you can now take a skin cell and encourage it to become a liver cell or a heart cell or a kidney cell or a brain cell for any of us .
if you don &apos;t believe me , just ask sam .
and for us young people , they &apos;re looking to become individuals and find their differences amongst themselves .
we &apos;re here , we &apos;re part of a community , sharing out ideas and discus@@ sing them .
this institution is govern@@ ment@@ -@@ bac@@ ked and it has been the case for the past three decades .
useless .
my work is -- it &apos;s a reflection of myself .
at that age , obviously , i couldn &apos;t express it that way , but i told her i didn &apos;t feel right .
it became part of me .
and i looked at it beneath the microscope . and some of it was flat .
so to cut the story short , i decided that i had to go back and do it .
can anybody see the bla@@ de on the end of that needle ?
and i looked at it underneath the microscope .
i remember one time i was doing it , and the window was open .
i used a microscopic sh@@ ard of diam@@ ond to actually car@@ ve the actual base .
constructed each plan@@ k of gold .
and these doctors or these masters , these spiritual masters of the su@@ fi tradition , refer to teach@@ ings and examples of our pro@@ ph@@ et that teach us where the source of our problems lies .
all we have to do is to get our e@@ gos out of the way , get our e@@ go@@ tism out of the way .
and these should also be the primary attribu@@ tes of what it means to be human .
and one day i was exploring this cul@@ -@@ de-@@ sa@@ c hidden away a few streets away .
the next day i came to see him . i was like , &quot; doctor , that was a really good joke . &quot;
in ar@@ kansas they don &apos;t even ask . &quot;
and jeff came up be@@ side me and said , &quot; so , have you ever been cow ti@@ pping ? &quot;
two weeks after my diagnosis , a bi@@ op@@ sy con@@ fir@@ med i had a seven@@ -@@ inch o@@ ste@@ o@@ sar@@ com@@ a in my left fe@@ mu@@ r .
and i hun@@ g up the phone , and i put my face in my hands , and i scre@@ amed this silent scre@@ am .
and one of the profound things that happened was this act of actually connecting to all these people .
don &apos;t give in to the wall .
and every seven sets of seven years , the land gets an extra year of rest during which time all families are re@@ united and people surrounded with the ones they love .
so if you go to 2@@ 3@@ and@@ me , or if you go to coun@@ ci@@ lo@@ f@@ d@@ ad@@ s@@ .com , you can click on a link .
a@@ o : you did teach yourself to play , and as a consequence , playing the piano for you , derek , was a lot of k@@ nuc@@ k@@ les and kar@@ ate ch@@ ops , and even a bit of nose going on in there .
and hopefully we can show the audience now how it is you do what you do .

this is known as the theme building ; that is its name for reasons that are still very mur@@ ky .
does anyone know ? ch@@ i ?
they &apos;re fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that &apos;s clean , a world that isn &apos;t conta@@ minated , a world that isn &apos;t pollu@@ ted .
and we use g@@ si -- geographic whatever it is , g@@ si -- to determine the range of the chim@@ ps .
we now know that at g@@ om@@ be alone , there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes .
so , the sad thing is that these chimpanzees -- who &apos;ve perhaps taught us , more than any other creature , a little hu@@ mil@@ ity -- are in the wild , disappe@@ aring very fast .
the one thing we have , which makes us so different from chimpanzees or other living creatures , is this sophisticated spoken language -- a language with which we can tell children about things that aren &apos;t here .
there &apos;s little bro@@ ch@@ ures all around outside , and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future , i be@@ g that you pick up that bro@@ ch@@ ure .
we want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral hi@@ stories .
and i believe that a group like this can have a very major impact , not just because you can share technology with us , but because so many of you have children .
it &apos;s in your hands and my hands and those of our children .
so how do we do this ? well , we use a model system that we term a protocell .
it could run a metaboli@@ sm on it .
it can sense its local environment and actually find resources in the environment to sustain itself .
so since we can make some interesting proto@@ cells that we like , interesting colors and interesting behaviors , and they &apos;re very easy to make , and they have interesting life@@ like properties , perhaps these proto@@ cells have something to tell us about the origin of life on the earth . perhaps these represent an easily accessible step , one of the first steps by which life got started on the early earth .
this is used in reference to a report in 2007 by the national research council in the united states , where@@ in they tried to understand how we can look for life elsewhere in the universe , okay , especially if that life is very different from life on earth . if we went to another planet and we thought there might be life there , how could we even recognize it as life ?
80 to 90 percent of their time was spent on five things .
the cul@@ mination of this is if you &apos;ve successfully raised your ta@@ d@@ pole , obser@@ ving the behavioral and develop@@ mental events , you will then go and introduce your ta@@ d@@ pole to its na@@ me@@ sake and discuss the evidence that you &apos;ve seen .
there &apos;s an old cell@@ phone in there -- a good use for old cell@@ phones -- which di@@ als the clinic , we go and pick up the mouse .
what the climate crisis has revealed to us is a secon@@ dary , more insi@@ di@@ ous and more per@@ va@@ sive crisis , which is the crisis of agency , which is what to do .
and then i swa@@ p it out with the students and actually re-@@ release that carbon black .
and an early test which argument e@@ lic@@ ited cooperative behavior from the people below -- about a hundred to one decided that this was the argument that worked best on us .
in this case , instead of throwing che@@ wing gu@@ m , or dor@@ it@@ os or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish -- there &apos;s a body of water in iceland that i &apos;ve been dealing with that &apos;s in the middle of the city , and the largest pollution burden on it is not the ro@@ ad@@ bor@@ ne pollution , it &apos;s actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds .
did you know that today we maintain a global her@@ d of 60 billion animals to provide our meat , da@@ ir@@ y , eggs and leather goods ?
the animal could be a cow , la@@ mb , or even something more ex@@ otic .
it need not look like this , which is actually the state of the art today .
he didn &apos;t write &quot; little red laptop computer &quot; or &quot; little red dirt devil . &quot;
and sequ@@ el truly is a real car .
we actually think the future &apos;s going to be ev@@ ent-@@ driven .
and secondly , it &apos;s a fundamental business proposition .
so my mom said , &quot; you &apos;re going on a bus an hour and a half away from where we live every day . &quot;
he &apos;s like , &quot; no , miss , i &apos;m not going .
animation , software , mo@@ vie@@ making software , they have it all .
when i was 15 years old , it was necessary for me to leave this place and go to a town a little bit bigger -- much bigger -- where i did the second part of secon@@ dary school .
you must stop . stop .
we worked with a lot of companies in brazil that put money into this project , the government .
i put the question -- three or four weeks ago , we saw in the newspapers millions of fish that die in nor@@ way .
we here inside the room , i believe that we have the same concern , and the model that we created in brazil , we can transplant it here .
i &apos;d go to times square and i &apos;d look at the amazing ladies on the wall , and wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them .
you can see the li@@ sp@@ en@@ ard mea@@ dows dra@@ ining down through here , through what is tri@@ be@@ ca now , and the be@@ aches that come up from the battery , all the way to 4@@ 2@@ n@@ d st .
we know that there was a len@@ ap@@ e sett@@ lement down here by the collect pon@@ d .
and rapidly we started to realize that bea@@ vers can be something that a bo@@ b@@ cat needs .
and perhaps a black bear walked by . and maybe native americans were there .
and even though i &apos;ve only had a brief time to speak , i hope you appreciate that man@@ na@@ hatt@@ a was a very special place .
and , you know , built the society that we now live in .
and they may not want to live exactly like us .
and people who live in cities in the developed world tend to be very prosper@@ ous , and thus use a lot of stuff .
another thing that information technology lets us do is start figuring out how to use less stuff by knowing , and by monitoring , the amount we &apos;re actually using .
most of those c@@ ites are growing incredibly quickly .
so one of the things that that &apos;s leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion .
so l@@ ul@@ a , he &apos;s full of problems , full of contradi@@ ctions , but one of the things that he &apos;s doing is , he is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations that completely shifts the balance from the standard sort of nor@@ th-@@ south dialogue into a whole new way of global collaboration .
here &apos;s a design for di@@ sti@@ lling water using sunlight .
you know , that it &apos;s not just enough to survive .
sop@@ a stands for the stop online pir@@ acy act .
we do like to consume , but every time one of these new tools came along , it turned out we also like to produce and we like to share .
that is a side effect of their ordinary operation .
so this is the internet they have in mind .
they don &apos;t want legal distin@@ ctions between legal and illegal sharing .
it changed my life .
&quot; what are you doing here ?
so the college works following the lifestyle and work@@ style of ma@@ hat@@ ma gandhi .
we are the only ones who actually returned the award for $ 50,000 , because they didn &apos;t believe us , and we thought that they were actually casting as@@ per@@ sions on the b@@ are@@ foot architects of ti@@ lon@@ ia .
but the people who fab@@ ri@@ cated that solar cook@@ er are women , il@@ liter@@ ate women , who actually fab@@ ri@@ cate the most sophisticated solar cook@@ er .
she has a ca@@ bin@@ et , a minister of education , a minister for energy , a minister for health .
men are re@@ st@@ less , men are ambitious , men are compu@@ l@@ sively mobile , and they all want a certi@@ fi@@ cate .
and they haven &apos;t collapsed .
i knew which woman i would like to take .
don &apos;t listen to the world bank , listen to the people on the ground .
our narrative here is real f@@ mri data that &apos;s ma@@ pped visually and son@@ ically .
oxygen , hydrogen and z@@ in@@ c have their own signature .
and yet in two million years the human brain has nearly tri@@ pled in mass , going from the one-@@ and-@@ a-@@ quarter pound brain of our ance@@ stor here , ha@@ bil@@ is , to the almost three-@@ pound me@@ at@@ lo@@ a@@ f that everybody here has between their ears .
because the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs , and a year after winning the lot@@ to , lottery win@@ ners and par@@ ap@@ leg@@ ics are equally happy with their lives .
who are these characters who are so damn happy ?
and then finally -- you know , the best of all possible worlds -- some of you recognize this young photo of pe@@ te best , who was the original dru@@ m@@ mer for the beat@@ les , until they , you know , sent him out on an er@@ r@@ and and s@@ nuc@@ k away and picked up rin@@ go on a tour .
in this case , because the experiment i &apos;m going to tell you about uses them , these are mon@@ et prints .
we explained we would have number three ma@@ iled to them .
it turns out that freedom -- the ability to make up your mind and change your mind -- is the friend of natural happiness , because it allows you to choose among all those delicious fu@@ tures and find the one that you would most enjoy .
so we gave them cameras ; they went around campus ; they took 12 pictures of their favorite professors and their dor@@ m room and their dog , and all the other things they wanted to have harvard memories of .
they don &apos;t like their picture , and in fact even after the opportunity to swa@@ p has ex@@ pi@@ red , they still don &apos;t like their picture . why ?
thank you .
sometimes they just explo@@ de before your eyes or come down su@@ person@@ ic .
i have a little cu@@ ban mother -- she &apos;s about that big .
&quot; pa@@ p@@ i , help . &quot;
i was born in 19 -- i forget , and i came to this country with them in the after@@ math of the cu@@ ban revolution .
and that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up to take her to have her hair d@@ yed , you know , that pecu@@ liar color of blue that mat@@ ches her poly@@ est@@ er pants suit , you know , same color as the bu@@ ick .
she gets into the car -- she &apos;s sitting on two phone books .
it &apos;ll help my breathing . it &apos;ll do something for my pulse , maybe .
now , you have all been at a mall during the holi@@ days , yes ?
by now , we have now cra@@ w@@ led another four feet , and my mother finally says to me , &quot; i knew it , i knew it .
we &apos;ll wait for the slow ones . ok .
&quot; no , my daughter , she &apos;s coming in the bu@@ ick .
people are watching us all around , &quot; right ?
i almost miss it .
what zi@@ p@@ car does is we park cars throughout dense urban areas for members to reserve , by the hour and by the day , instead of using their own car .
it required that it was completely trivial : that it takes 30 seconds to reserve a car , go get it , drive it .
so again , we can see that price plays an enormous role in people &apos;s wil@@ ling@@ ness to reduce their driving behavior .
these are also called mesh networks .
these are the next two lines in the movie .
and this open-source version means that it could be -- if we did a brilliant job of it -- it could be used around the world very quickly .
2006 was a great year .
and as these dark clouds were cir@@ c@@ ling me , and i was finding it really , really difficult to think of anything good , i said to myself that i really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow .
i &apos;d love to just talk about each one briefly .
so there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work .
so those are the three a &apos;s .
he &apos;s like , &quot; do you know where mor@@ oc@@ co even is ? &quot;
and that &apos;s the sad part .
tou@@ rist : i think that people are very frustrated that they &apos;re not able to get closer to see what &apos;s going on .
and i thought it was astonishing to spe@@ cul@@ ate , as if this were a competition , on something that was such a fresh w@@ ound .
d@@ r : it was not an inclu@@ sive group .
so dealing with it is just an immediate master plan .
sort of like the spinal tap scene where you get the tiny little st@@ one@@ h@@ enge , i guess ?
it &apos;s all incredibly hu@@ mble material .
and i truly believe until the issue of memor@@ ial is sor@@ ted out , that it &apos;s going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion .
those kinds of forms ?
so you can get kind of a feel for this .
but how about the kid on the left , or the ath@@ lete that leaves the field of play ?
let me tell you what i &apos;ve come up with .
how old it is ?
and today , we have what is perhaps our most offen@@ sive definition , at least to me , which is the following : to dood@@ le offici@@ ally means to da@@ w@@ dle , to di@@ l@@ ly d@@ ally , to monkey around , to make meaning@@ less marks , to do something of little value , substance or im@@ port , and -- my personal favorite -- to do nothing .
we think dood@@ ling is something you do when you lose focus , but in reality , it is a pre@@ emp@@ tive measure to stop you from losing focus .
in 2002 , a group of treatment activi@@ sts met to discuss the early development of the airplane .
treatment programs became possible , funding became available , and the number of people on anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs started to increase very rapidly .
so surely if a patent pool could be established to ra@@ mp up the production of military airplanes , we should be able to do something similar to tackle the hiv / aids epidemic .
the rule is about a 10-@@ year del@@ ay for a new product to go to market in developing countries , if at all .
what about ath@@ ens ? med@@ iter@@ ran@@ e@@ an climate , but in the sun it was not comfortable . they didn &apos;t perceive comfort .
instead of blowing a hur@@ ri@@ cane of chil@@ led air through the sta@@ dium , we can use radi@@ ant cooling technologies , like a floor heating system where water pipes are embedded in the floor .
and i also hope that you share the idea that if engineers and designers can use all these different cli@@ matic para@@ meters , it will be possible to create really good and comfortable out@@ door conditions , to change our thermal perception that we feel comfortable in an out@@ door environment , and we can do that with the best passive design , but also using the energy source of the site in q@@ atar which is the sun .
the main thing is a fi@@ x-@@ it-@@ locally culture , which is fantastic because it means that your product or your service doesn &apos;t have to go through a huge bureauc@@ ra@@ tic system to get it fixed .
they are basically refer@@ r@@ al services , essentially .
so we are right now doing some systematic field tests to basically as@@ certain whether something like this actually makes sense to the asha worker .
and i started to see the world in a whole new way , like pairs of people connected to each other .
and , most importantly , what causes the clu@@ sters ?
and we thought this was a very interesting comment on america , and a kind of self-@@ serving , &quot; not my responsibility &quot; kind of phenomenon .
i mean , there would be an advantage to experiencing our emotions inside , you know , anger or happiness .
so to inv@@ o@@ ke another metaphor , if you imagine social networks as a kind of vast fabric of humanity -- i &apos;m connected to you and you to her , on out end@@ lessly into the distance -- this fabric is actually like an old-@@ fashi@@ oned american qu@@ il@@ t , and it has pat@@ ches on it : happy and unhappy pat@@ ches .
that &apos;s my social experience . &quot;
they &apos;re both made of carbon , and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it that are arran@@ ged in one particular way -- on the left -- and you get graph@@ ite , which is soft and dark .
you read about it in your newspapers .
the c@@ d@@ c recently conducted a survey where they asked respon@@ dents simply to tell them whether they experienced significant psychological di@@ stress in the previous week .
in our study , they are more positive , but they &apos;re also more likely than younger people to experience mixed emotions -- sa@@ dness at the same time you experience happiness ; you know , that tear in the eye when you &apos;re smiling at a friend .
we go on blind dates .
i mean , this is literally human beings with super-@@ human strength and abilities .
we got mad@@ d cha@@ d@@ d , li@@ l &apos; c , kid david and j smooth .
the l@@ x@@ d electri@@ fy the ted@@ 2010 stage with an emerging global stre@@ e@@ t-@@ dance culture , rev@@ ved up by the internet . in a pre@@ view of j@@ on ch@@ u &apos;s up@@ coming web series , this astonishing trou@@ pe show off their super@@ powers .
according to the treat@@ y , those lands are a so@@ ver@@ ei@@ g@@ n nation .
we had plans .
on december 2@@ 9@@ th , u.s. troops surrounded a si@@ ou@@ x en@@ ca@@ mp@@ ment at w@@ ounded knee cre@@ ek and mass@@ ac@@ red chief big foot and 300 prisoners of war , using a new rapi@@ d-@@ fire weapon that fired explo@@ ding shel@@ ls called a hot@@ ch@@ ki@@ ss gun .
2010 : statistics about native population today , more than a century after the mass@@ acre at w@@ ounded knee , reveal the legacy of colon@@ ization , forced migration and treat@@ y vio@@ lations .
those events led to a domin@@ o effect that has yet to end .
so , that &apos;s really the goal of my talk , is to a , communicate that moment to you and b , have you leave this session a little du@@ mber than when you entered .
many of these deaths were completely prev@@ ent@@ able , and this what i want to think of as the dis@@ concer@@ ting thing , what i want to call &quot; the last mile &quot; problem .
inter@@ cro@@ pping . inter@@ cro@@ pping really increases income .
so , here are these women . they &apos;ve seen their parents have stru@@ gg@@ led with diarrhea , they &apos;ve stru@@ gg@@ led with diarrhea , they &apos;ve seen lots of deaths . how do they answer this question ?
so , somebody out there says , &quot; five . &quot;
almost out of kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten .
they are saying , &quot; this is 35 miles per gall@@ on . i &apos;m going to do the environ@@ mentally right thing , i &apos;m going to buy the pri@@ us , 50 miles per gall@@ on . &quot;
now , this is an example of that battle , and makes us realize inten@@ tions don &apos;t always translate into action , and so one of the fundamental challenges is how we would actually do that . ok ?
this isn &apos;t about the biology of people ; this is now about the brains , the psychology of people , and innovation needs to continue all the way through the last mile .
the careful testing , re@@ testing , design , are going to open up vi@@ st@@ as of understanding , comple@@ xi@@ ties , difficult things .
mac@@ arthur winner sen@@ d@@ hi@@ l mul@@ la@@ in@@ athan uses the lens of behavioral economics to study a tri@@ cky set of social problems -- those we know how to solve , but don &apos;t . we know how to reduce child deaths due to diarrhea , how to prevent diabe@@ te@@ s-@@ related blindness and how to imple@@ ment sol@@ ar-@@ cell technology ... yet somehow , we don &apos;t or can &apos;t . why ?
right , the current wants to run through the pla@@ y-@@ dough , not through that led .
so i would encourage you all to grab some pla@@ y-@@ do@@ h , grab some salt , grab some sugar and start playing .
and a friend of mine in au@@ stri@@ a felt so sorry for me that he talked the largest ca@@ sin@@ o owner in lin@@ z into letting us wrap his building .
but i will demonstrate different ways to get rid of diffic@@ ul@@ ties and go to the point , to find an answer probably much quic@@ ker than arthur did . so , first , we viol@@ ate the common sense , the logic . all of you , if you hold your hand like this , 90 degrees -- all of you . not you .
now , i need an assi@@ stant .
that &apos;s a challenge . i like this .
so here i have , actually -- i know exactly where the cards are .
and if you work with , in the right atmosphere , with humor , you have -- that &apos;s the pas@@ s@@ word to the cosmic bank of knowledge , where you can find any solution of any problem .
and then , i will demonstrate a thing from russian satellite , ste@@ al@@ en -- stolen , probably copied from america but we will see .
when i lift the hea@@ p , i pe@@ ek .
we do it again .
this is a kind of optical deal , right ?
now -- -- one guy laugh@@ ed . so now , to find the queen , do it this way : take back the other one , take back the queen .
king of sp@@ ades .
do with both hands , and quick . yes , good , good .
right ? good .
two -- and it was two of sp@@ ades , right ?
yes ? zo@@ e : yeah .
king of diam@@ on@@ ds . lg : ah !
now , what happened was not maybe what you thought , which is , he suddenly became passionate , engaged , involved , got a new teacher , he hit pu@@ ber@@ ty , or whatever it is .
and your children are playing instruments .
the ton@@ e-@@ deaf people , they &apos;re no longer here .
now , it goes down to a. now to g@@ . and then to f .
and then finally ...
finally , i said , &quot; why am i cla@@ pping ? &quot;
he depends , for his power , on his ability to make other people powerful .
unfortunately , it was the last thing she ever said to him , because she never saw him again . he did not survive .
some of you might have seen this before .
it &apos;s a nice motiv@@ ator .
so g@@ luc@@ k@@ s@@ berg did another experiment similar to this where he presented the problem in a slightly different way , like this up here . okay ?
the rules are my@@ sti@@ fying .
what happens ?
these are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system for our businesses .
it &apos;s pretty . it &apos;s not bad . it &apos;s a huge tra@@ de@@ mark vio@@ lation , but it &apos;s pretty clever .
do it for fun . no one gets paid a cent , or a e@@ ur@@ o or a y@@ en .
so , it can balance on a point .
so here is the earth . it &apos;s a little less than a millimeter that was turned of solid bron@@ ze .
this is another species of work that i do .
and the idea that you could see things inside of a cryst@@ al ball and predict the future -- or a television set , where it &apos;s sort of like a magic box where anything can appear .
it &apos;s completely silent and non@@ pollu@@ ting .
the real social innovation i want to talk about involves charity .
you know , you want to make 50 million dollars selling violent video games to kids , go for it .
char@@ itable giving has remained stuck , in the u.s. , at two percent of gdp ever since we started measuring it in the 1970s .
well , like most fan@@ a@@ tical do@@ g@@ ma in america , these ideas come from old pur@@ it@@ an beliefs .
within nine years , we had multipli@@ ed that 1,@@ 9@@ 8@@ 2 times into 10@@ 8 million dollars after all expen@@ ses for aids services .
but if we could move char@@ itable giving from two percent of gdp up just one step to three percent of gdp , by investing in that growth , that would be an extra 150 billion dollars a year in contribu@@ tions , and if that money could go dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately to health and human services ch@@ arities , because those were the ones we encouraged to invest in their growth , that would represent a tri@@ pling of contribu@@ tions to that sector .
and suddenly , out of the chaos , order .
you know , audiences like you , yeah , make the event .
can we have a little demonstration ? would you be my orchestra for a second ?
and our joy of music , etc . , etc . ... &quot;
and then like k@@ ara@@ j@@ an . let &apos;s see what happens . okay ?
meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything .
this is very exciting for those players .
rather enjoying what the so@@ lo@@ ist is doing .
you know why ? because the meaning of the music is pain .
but all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the glob@@ alized economic growth model , and moder@@ ating what comes in at one end , and moder@@ ating the out@@ puts at the other end .
but are we to assume that the same brilli@@ ance and creativity and adap@@ tability that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is somehow mysteri@@ ously going to eva@@ por@@ ate when we have to design a creative way back down the other side ?
and in terms of climate change , is something that is not actually fea@@ sible .
it lear@@ ns very much from its mistakes .
so it started out with some work i was involved in in ireland , where i was teaching , and has since spread .
from three years ago , it just being an idea , this has become something that has vir@@ ally swe@@ pt around the world .
well , this is about state bud@@ gets .
there are various things in here : i could say we might raise more revenue , or medical innovation will make the spending even higher .
is anyone paying attention to some of the things these guys do ?
and unfortunately , as you get into that , people get confused and think , well maybe you think that &apos;s okay .
so what do we need to do ?
it allows us to do the art , the bi@@ otechnology , the software and all those magic things .
and after two more years of studying music , i decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the mc@@ at and applying to medical school like a good indian son to become the next dr. gu@@ p@@ ta .
ke@@ ats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pursue poetry , but he died when he was a year older than me .
anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the smell .
these people i still do hang out with .
all right , next .
don &apos;t they just pop into your head ?
it &apos;s amazing . it &apos;s a wonderful moment .
had he shown his father , &quot; my boy has finally lost it , &quot; he would &apos;ve thought .
the french writer mich@@ el t@@ our@@ ni@@ er has a famous saying .
and i explained , &quot; it &apos;s a dark night and a cro@@ w is per@@ ching on a branch . &quot;
yes , it means i didn &apos;t have to draw gy@@ e@@ on@@ gho@@ er@@ u .
we become dict@@ ators with a remote and start to critici@@ ze the people on tv .
i walk around and encourage them , &quot; come on , come on ! &quot; they have to write like crazy for an hour or two .
art is the ultimate goal .
only those three words and she left the airport . that &apos;s it .
british physicist john ty@@ n@@ d@@ all , in the 18@@ 50 &apos;s , made laboratory measurements of the inf@@ r@@ ared radiation , which is heat .
i had been using the first line of the nasa mission statement , &quot; to understand and protect the home planet , &quot; to justi@@ fy my talks .
climate change den@@ i@@ ers argue that the sun is the main cause of climate change .
methane is also beginning to escape from the per@@ ma@@ fro@@ st .
it would be im@@ moral to leave these young people with a climate system spir@@ aling out of control .
the science is clear .
my favorite and a real hero of mine is y@@ ak@@ im@@ a can@@ u@@ tt .
we can do bigger car stun@@ ts than ever before now .
i sort of forget how bizarre some of those conversations are .
two stun@@ t guys doing what i consider to be a rather ben@@ ign stun@@ t .
it &apos;s that shape because the helium has to expand .
it took me a while ; it took me years to find the right balloon team to build the balloon that would do this job .
i cont@@ acted a company in the states who make suits for nasa .
this is a very ligh@@ tw@@ eight suit . it weigh@@ s about 15 pounds .
but if you are , and you say to somebody , you know , they say , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
do you remember the story ? no , it was big .
in fact , we moved from str@@ at@@ ford to los angeles .
why not ? i think this is rather important .
so the hierarchy is ro@@ oted on two ideas .
in fact , creativity -- which i define as the process of having original ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different discipl@@ inary ways of seeing things .
i said , &quot; what happened ? &quot;
now is the time for us to laugh at ourselves , before others can laugh with us .
so i re@@ treated back to my cave and continued to support and produce comedy and let my friends use my cou@@ ch as a regi@@ onal operations hu@@ b .
so everywhere we went , we audi@@ tioned amate@@ urs .
one : is the middle east being shown in a current time and correct context ?
early detection , early intervention , that &apos;s the story for these success@@ es .
fif@@ ty percent will have on@@ set by age 14 , 75 percent by age 24 , a picture that is very different than what one would see if you &apos;re talking about cancer or heart disease , diabetes , hyper@@ tension -- most of the major ill@@ ne@@ sses that we think about as being sources of mor@@ bi@@ dity and mortality .
the important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these disorders , the one in five of us who struggle in some way , you find that there &apos;s a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired , but there are some predictable patterns , and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these disorders .
but this tells us how we need to think about it , and where we need to go .
how many children will you get ?
but how wrong it is .
it &apos;s very interesting . when we started our school the parents would give thu@@ mb@@ prints in the atten@@ dance regi@@ ster .
there they met children who are with a different standard and a different mindset , a totally different society .
is it the exposure ? we have professors from mit , ber@@ ke@@ ley , stanford , indian institute of science who come and teach our children lots of scientific formul@@ as , experiments , much beyond the classroom .
when i started par@@ i@@ k@@ r@@ ma i began with a great deal of arro@@ g@@ ance of transforming the world .
now that sounds like an incredibly straightforward question to answer , and that &apos;s what howard thought . because pep@@ si told him , &quot; look , we &apos;re working with a band between eight and 12 percent .
you should be looking for the perfect pep@@ sis . &quot;
every concei@@ vable way you can vary spa@@ ghet@@ ti sauce , he vari@@ ed spa@@ ghet@@ ti sauce .
what howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks about making you happy .
much more vo@@ la@@ tile brown mu@@ star@@ d seed , some white wine , a nose hit , much more deli@@ cate ar@@ om@@ a@@ tics . and what do they do ?
and she ser@@ ves it that way time and time again , and if you quar@@ re@@ l with her , she will say , &quot; you know what ? you &apos;re wrong ! this is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant . &quot;
if i were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee -- a type of coffee , a bre@@ w -- that made all of you happy , and then i asked you to rate that coffee , the average score in this room for coffee would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100 .
we have pre-@@ can@@ cer@@ ous le@@ sions , which often don &apos;t turn into cancer .
if you develop a disease , you &apos;re off the island .
it was when i became a journalist that i really realized how i was part of this problem , and how we all are part of this problem .
so , dad graduated harvard in 194@@ 6 , married my mom , and bought a house in lex@@ ington , mass@@ achu@@ set@@ ts , where the first shots were fired against the british in 17@@ 75 , although we didn &apos;t actually hit any of them until con@@ cord .
and , yeah , we can look back in retro@@ spect and say , yeah , ha@@ -@@ ha , you know -- it &apos;s all micro@@ film . but that &apos;s -- that &apos;s not the point . he understood the shape of the future .
and if you go on the diag@@ onal , you get content and form -- and then beauty and truth .
so i wrote a book about this in &apos; 9@@ 3 , but as i was fin@@ ishing the book , i had to do a little bit of ty@@ pe@@ setting , and i was tired of going to my local copy shop to do it , so i bought a computer .
we could do cir@@ cular narratives that were literally cir@@ cular .
why is this important ?
now maybe that &apos;s been obvious to all of you for a long time , but for me , as often as i &apos;d en@@ counter@@ ed that exact difficulty on a daily basis , i had never seen the inher@@ ent challenge of communication in so cryst@@ all@@ ine a light .
and the key detail of this is that fe@@ y &apos;s scrip@@ ts weren &apos;t written by her and they weren &apos;t written by the s@@ n@@ l writers .
because from what i can tell , the three things gay americans seem to want most are to join the military , get married and start a family .
but it &apos;s when you put all of these elements together -- when you get the viral appe@@ al of a great joke with a powerful pun@@ ch@@ line that &apos;s cra@@ fted from honest@@ y and integr@@ ity , it can have a real world impact at changing a conversation .
that is a lot of punch for 14 words .
how far back does that go ? how far back does modern language go ?
it reaches up to almost 5,000 pounds -- on a diet of jellyfish , primarily .
they school as adolesc@@ ents , and become be@@ he@@ mot@@ h lon@@ ers as adults .
so the great thing about the mo@@ la is that when we put the tag on them -- if you look up here -- that &apos;s stre@@ aming off , that &apos;s right where we put the tag .
and they come and give the mol@@ as -- you can see they strike this funny little position that says , &quot; i &apos;m not threat@@ ening , but i need a ma@@ ssa@@ ge . &quot;
but also what &apos;s important is that they &apos;re not s@@ l@@ ac@@ ker , la@@ zy fish .
it was a 200@@ -@@ foot diameter geo@@ de@@ sic sphere to be susp@@ ended over the east river in new york city , in full view of the united nations .
i &apos;ve got a little video to show you , but keep in mind that this is with no electronic control , and this is also with only four le@@ ds .
how does it feel to see someone like this come along taking your art and doing so much with it ?
he realized at once what had happened .
so , have we all become one-@@ eyed -- two-@@ eyed instead of one-@@ eyed -- monkeys ?
and then ab@@ original women in africa would come and say , &quot; this is it ! &quot;
i have a solution that requires neither machine , nor wood , nor cooking gas .
your parents were peaceful people .
hello governments of rich countries selling arms to governments of poor countries who can &apos;t even afford to give them food .
her father the king said , &quot; don &apos;t whist@@ le . &quot;
&quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ huh ... &quot; she said .
and le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z was the first person to really talk about building such a machine .
von neu@@ mann , and a log@@ ician , and a mathematician from the army put this together . then , they needed a place to build it .
so , there &apos;s 40 of these tubes , like a v-@@ 40 engine running the memory .
&quot; mani@@ ac re@@ gained its memory , when the power went off . &quot; &quot; machine or human ? &quot;
this now is the third different output .
so he designed this universe , and ran it .
and it was his universe on punch cards .
and that &apos;s the end .
look at hom@@ icide at the bottom , for god &apos;s sake .
i went to west virginia , the most un@@ healthy state in america .
you see , the thing is obesity and di@@ e@@ t-@@ related disease doesn &apos;t just hurt the people that have it ; it &apos;s all of their friends , families , brothers , sisters .
now it &apos;s largely process@@ ed and full of all sorts of addi@@ tives , extra ingredients , and you know the rest of the story .
normal . let &apos;s get on schools , something that i &apos;m fairly much a speci@@ alist in .
they have sci@@ ss@@ ors in the classroom , but kni@@ ves and for@@ ks ? no .
i want to talk about something so basic as milk .
this , all this bad news , is prev@@ ent@@ able .
so , these guys are going to be part of the solution .
hun@@ t@@ ington &apos;s kitchen . hun@@ t@@ ington , where i made this program , you know , we &apos;ve got this pri@@ me-@@ time program that hopefully will inspire people to really get on this change .
dy@@ sle@@ x@@ ic , so i &apos;m a bit slow .
in fact , a friend of mine from the security industry told me the other day that there are two types of companies in the world : those that know they &apos;ve been ha@@ cked , and those that don &apos;t .
they &apos;re completely anonymous , as it were .
and that challenge is : how do you do business , how do you trust somebody on the web who you want to do business with when you know that they &apos;re a criminal ?
now he developed his social and moral compas@@ s on the black sea port during the 1990s .
and this man with a plan@@ et@@ ar@@ y-@@ sized brain is now serving a 13@@ -@@ year sentence in california .
thank you very much for listening .
public health is another reason to consider retro@@ f@@ itting .
and the market research , consumer research , asking the boom@@ ers and gen y what it is they would like , what they would like to live in , tells us there is going to be a huge demand -- and we &apos;re already seeing it -- for more urban life@@ sty@@ les within subur@@ bia .
it &apos;s been so successful , they &apos;ve now taken over the strip across the street .
this one is one of my favorites , bel@@ mar .
you want to also try to get more syste@@ mic transformation .
the first is to plan retro@@ f@@ itting much more syste@@ mic@@ ally at the metro@@ polit@@ an scale .
but we &apos;ve got to get the architecture better .
so i decided to talk to women about their vag@@ in@@ as .
and she said things that really shocked me about her vagina -- that it was dri@@ e@@ d-@@ up and finished and dead -- and i was kind of shocked .
and so in 199@@ 7 , i said , &quot; let &apos;s get women together .
and i really love hearing about all these species at the bottom of the sea .
she went to ju@@ are@@ z to take care of an a@@ iling a@@ unt , and over the course of it , she began to discover what was happening to the mur@@ dered and disappeared women of ju@@ are@@ z .
but , being a vagina warri@@ or , she kept going , and she kept commit@@ ting herself to transforming consciousness .
well , it seems to me that this hun@@ g@@ arian presence in my life is difficult to account for , but ultimately i as@@ cri@@ be it to an admi@@ ration for people with a complex moral awareness , with a heritage of guil@@ t and defe@@ at matched by de@@ fi@@ ance and bra@@ va@@ do .
and then one day , it happened : he and his family were arrested and they were taken to a death house on the dan@@ u@@ be .
mr. tes@@ z@@ ler hired 16 men : eight white , eight black .
and into the slow , second movement , mar@@ ked &quot; ada@@ gi@@ o religi@@ o@@ so , &quot; he in@@ corpor@@ ated the sounds of bir@@ d@@ song that he heard outside his window in what he knew would be his last spring ; he was imagining a future for her in which he would play no part .
and it was only at that moment , as we were sitting down to dinner , that i recognized the enor@@ m@@ ity of the risk i had created , because to bring these two ti@@ t@@ ans , these two masters of the universe together -- it was like introduc@@ ing mo@@ th@@ ra to god@@ z@@ il@@ la over the sky@@ line of tok@@ yo .
and i -- no one else did , so i put up my hand , and i said , &quot; it &apos;s a bac@@ chan@@ al by ti@@ tian . &quot;
and in about 199@@ 7 , the th@@ en@@ -@@ director philipp@@ e de mon@@ te@@ bel@@ lo gave me the go@@ -@@ ahead to organize an exhibition for 2002 . we normally have these very long lead@@ -@@ in times .
and in this extraordinary setting , the co@@ stu@@ mes were like actors and ac@@ tre@@ sses , or living sculp@@ tures .
i &apos;m working to try and break down that sense of that eli@@ tism .
but we take the severe ones , and we res@@ che@@ du@@ le the other ones the next day .
so we came up with these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother also , &#91; during the &#93; time of &#91; the &#93; soviet union .
and really when you think &#91; you &#93; cannot do it , she will push you , and i can do it .
i &apos;m going to take you on a 16@@ -@@ minute trip on 72 percent of the planet , so bu@@ ck@@ le up .
you know , we &apos;re going to do this , we &apos;re going to take it away from something else .
and like a living organism , you tear it open , it ble@@ eds its mol@@ ten blood , ri@@ ses up to he@@ al that w@@ ound from the asth@@ en@@ o@@ sphere , har@@ den@@ s , forms new tissue and moves lat@@ er@@ ally .
so , we came up with multiple hypothe@@ ses : there &apos;s little green people down there taking it ; there &apos;s all sorts of things going on .
we stu@@ mbled on it , looking for some missing heat .
near that was methane . i &apos;ve never seen volcan@@ oes of methane .
fortunately , we &apos;ve been able to convince congress .
this is a remote center at the university of washington .
thank you very much .
let &apos;s talk about what &apos;s suddenly possible .
since we opened the website in february , we now have 6@@ 40,000 students from 19@@ 0 countries .
other students might be interested in a particular en@@ rich@@ ment topic that they want to pursue individu@@ ally .
in addition to multiple choice and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video , we can also grade math , mathematical expressions as well as mathematical deri@@ vations .
which is not a level of service i have ever offered to my stanford students .
and finally , there was a population of students that were taught in a one-@@ on-@@ one in@@ struction using a tu@@ tor .
you can see , for example , that the achievement score almost doub@@ les in this particular experiment .
ka@@ ki king : playing &quot; pink noise &quot; on guit@@ ar
&quot; learn the lingu@@ a fran@@ ca . &quot;
e@@ mi@@ ly lev@@ ine : richard . what did i say ?
i don &apos;t know if you know this but -- maybe it &apos;s different now , or maybe you were making a statement -- but in many hospital nur@@ series across the country , until very recently anyway , according to a book by j@@ es@@ sic@@ a benjamin , the signs over the little boys cri@@ bs read , &quot; i &apos;m a boy , &quot; and the signs over the little girls cri@@ bs read , &quot; it &apos;s a girl . &quot; yeah .
so this whole subje@@ ct@@ -@@ object thing has relev@@ ance to humor in this way .
and i was sort of , as i was starting to analyze what exactly it is that i do , i read a book called &quot; tri@@ ck@@ ster makes this world , &quot; by lewis hy@@ de .
if they had had an olympics in mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom , my grandmother would have lost on purpose .
this is what i tend to see almost more than contradi@@ ctions .
and the mother is elderly .
and i like to explore all the possibilities in the hope that you &apos;ll be on the wa@@ vel@@ ength of your audience .
there are really serious cal@@ am@@ ities staring us in the eye that we &apos;re in the same kind of denial about that we were about terrorism , and what could &apos;ve happened on september 11 .
199@@ 5 , we found three . the count now is up to 80 -- we &apos;re finding about two or three a month .
it wasn &apos;t really a research report ; it was a scre@@ ed .
number seven : particle acceler@@ ator mi@@ sha@@ p .
now , corn origin@@ ated , we think , in mexico .
we need to learn how to repair and re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish the earth &apos;s o@@ zone layer .
we &apos;ve all learned what -- the kind of panic that can occur when an old disease re@@ ars its head , like an@@ th@@ ra@@ x .
but galaxies are very violent places , and things can be spu@@ n out of orbit .
of more concern , i think , is the astero@@ ids that exist between mars and ju@@ pit@@ er .
when the mission was over , they actually landed on the thing .
ba@@ sh@@ o was a brilliant man .
and these two war against one another almost continuously .
all right , let &apos;s talk about another perspective on the importance of the oceans .
mode@@ ling : on the right hand side , there &apos;s a very complex computational model .
we are already l@@ ac@@ ed up as if we &apos;re in a fiber op@@ tic cor@@ set , if you like .
this is going to be much more powerful than having a single ship in a single location , then move to a new location .
we pump the fluid through one of these systems , and we press the button , and it &apos;s analy@@ zed for the genom@@ ic character .
so we can bring an entirely new tele@@ presence to the world , throughout the ocean .
and i think that &apos;s really what architecture is based on .
and yet that energy and power of architecture has driven an entire social and political space that these buildings occupy .
it &apos;s like the old las ve@@ gas used to be .
our whole practice depends on computing .
and i do believe that this interaction with the history , with history that is often very difficult , to gra@@ pp@@ le with it , to create a position that is beyond our normal expectations and to create a cri@@ ti@@ que .
so again , the unexpected which is also the raw .
and it &apos;s not only our memory , but those who remember us , which means that architecture is not mu@@ te .
it &apos;s about creating with min@@ ima@@ l means something which can not be repeated , cannot be simul@@ ated in any other sphere .
compromise , if it &apos;s artistic , if it is able to c@@ ope with its strategies -- and there is my first ske@@ tch and the last ren@@ dering -- it &apos;s not that far away .
that sort of overall sustainable energy problem is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century , independent of environmental concerns .
br@@ un@@ o bo@@ w@@ den , who &apos;s here , did that , broke the world recor@@ d.@@ em : con@@ grat@@ u@@ lations .
by the end of this year , you &apos;ll be able to drive from l.a. to new york just using the super@@ char@@ ger network , which charges at five times the rate of anything else .
what are you doing ?
you &apos;re kind of building a new type of distributed u@@ tility .
would humanity become a space-@@ far@@ ing civilization ?
it &apos;s much like on a jet .
these projects are so -- pay@@ pal , sol@@ ar@@ city , tes@@ la , space@@ x , they &apos;re so spect@@ ac@@ ularly different , they &apos;re such ambitious projects at scale .
el@@ on mus@@ k , i wish we had all day , but thank you so much for coming to ted .
i grew up her@@ ding , looking after our livestock -- go@@ ats , sheep and cattle .
because it was war@@ time , the british .@@ 3@@ 0@@ 3 rif@@ le was just all over the whole country .
and thus , as people started feeling ownership over wildlife , wildlife numbers started coming back , and that &apos;s actually becoming a foundation for conservation in nam@@ i@@ bia .
the other partners that we have got is business communities .
in 2008 , conser@@ van@@ cy generated 5@@ .@@ 7 million dollars .
it allows for us to celebrate the se@@ af@@ ood that we &apos;re also so fortunate to eat .
well , how many bottles is it before you tell me that i have a problem ?
so i think we have this whole eating thing wrong .
they got more calories over the course of a diver@@ si@@ fied meal .
i remember well the meals of my childhood .
thank you .
and the great ir@@ ony and tragedy of our time is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that .
similarly , a lot of art projects stay in the art community , and i feel very much a responsibility through mechanisms like ted , and like our relationship with the obama white house , with the sen@@ ate , with john ker@@ ry , to influence policy as much as possible with these pictures as well .
you see the glac@@ ier flowing in from the right , dropping off into the sea , camera shooting every hour .
finally cat@@ ches up to itself , it advances .
all those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick , just a gi@@ gan@@ tic dom@@ e that comes in from the coast and ri@@ ses in the middle .
but what we have is a perception problem because not enough people really get it yet .
the more polit@@ e ones said , &quot; well , you know , indians make good software programmers and accoun@@ tants , but they can &apos;t do the creative stuff . &quot;
they were working on truly global products , and companies like microsoft , google , a@@ stra@@ z@@ ene@@ ca , general electric , phili@@ ps , have already answered in the af@@ fir@@ ma@@ tive the question that from their ban@@ gal@@ ore and hy@@ der@@ ab@@ ad r &amp; amp ; d centers they are able to produce products and services for the world .
it &apos;s not a new product or a new process but a new way to organize work , and the most significant management innovation to come out of india , invented by the indian off@@ shor@@ ing industry is what we call the global delivery model .
well , in 2010 , they decided they &apos;re not going to reveal this data anymore , so i had to make some estimates based on various sources .
for a time that i find to be the most plac@@ id and une@@ v@@ ent@@ ful hour of the day , four in the morning sure gets an awful lot of bad press -- across a lot of different media from a lot of big names .
100 years to the day after the death of al@@ f@@ red nobel himself .
and then -- three par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph@@ s later we get this little beauty : &quot; we went back to bla@@ ir house to look at the speech for the last time .
let me first address a few popular mis@@ concep@@ tions .
and when that cel@@ lular space station is within the electric field , it acts on those highly charged proteins and alig@@ ns them .
the expected five year survival is less than five percent .
and a year after that treatment , his tumor grew back with a ven@@ ge@@ ance .
i am the happ@@ iest , the happ@@ iest person in the world .
and i fir@@ m@@ ly believe that in the next 10 years tumor treating fields will be a weapon available to doctors and patients for all of these mo@@ st-@@ diffic@@ ul@@ t-@@ to-@@ treat solid tumors .
and you can notice they have created a kind of false cat@@ ch@@ ment .
the age is 400 years .
we had full-@@ page adverti@@ se@@ ments , some 30 years , 25 years ago when this can@@ al came .
and it &apos;s a kind of water body for all seas@@ ons .
and they have du@@ b@@ bed this water as the third one called &#91; unclear &#93; .
three sides , such steps , on the fourth side there is a four-@@ story building where you can organize such ted confer@@ ences any@@ time .
these arti@@ facts and designs are inspiring .
it doesn &apos;t matter if this is the jun@@ g@@ les of singa@@ pore or the tun@@ dr@@ a of northern fin@@ land .
and they &apos;re investing in tele@@ com@@ s , shopping m@@ alls .
south africa is playing a role .
how do you get from poverty and corruption to wealth and less corruption ?
and then something happened in 19@@ 80 .
invest .
but i think a much bigger problem with this is that this logic -- that we should be dropping i@@ pods not bombs -- i mean , it would make a fascinating title for thomas fri@@ ed@@ man &apos;s new book .
instead of trying to pur@@ ge these comm@@ ents , they instead went and reached out to the blog@@ gers .
right ? so they can go online and contribute ideas on what that region would look like by the year 2020 .
so what should we do about it ?
explain to me what &apos;s wrong .
no , the boy said to me -- the boy said to me , &quot; it would destroy me . &quot;
they called me an@@ th@@ ony growing up as a kid .
we had a whole choice of in@@ appropriate names for her .
the world i envi@@ sion for her -- how do i want men to be acting and be@@ having ?
soft power is a concept invented by a harvard academic , joseph ny@@ e , a friend of mine .
but sometimes it just sat there .
farmers now , who used to have to spend half a day of back@@ breaking labor to find out if the market town was open , if the market was on , whether the product they &apos;d harve@@ sted could be sold , what price they &apos;d fe@@ tch .
they had to su@@ spend functions at 8 : 30 .
and to this day remains the only jewish di@@ as@@ por@@ a in the history of the jewish people , which has never en@@ counter@@ ed a single incident of anti-@@ se@@ mi@@ tism .
it &apos;s the idea of an ever@@ -@@ ever@@ -@@ land , emerging from an ancient civilization , united by a shared history , but susta@@ ined , above all , by pl@@ ur@@ alist democracy .
tr@@ ach@@ om@@ a is an infection of the eye due to dirt can leave you perman@@ ently blind .
and another key thing that i learned a lot throughout this whole process , last year google named me as one of the bri@@ gh@@ test young minds in the world .
so probably it doesn &apos;t matter 50 years from now -- stre@@ p@@ to@@ co@@ c@@ cus and stuff like that will be ra@@ mp@@ ant -- because we won &apos;t be here . but if we are -- we &apos;re going to need something to do with the bacteria .
mission accomplished !
there &apos;s nothing intrin@@ sically sweet about honey .
it &apos;s important that we love babies , and that we not be put off by , say , messy dia@@ pers .
and he liked to do an exercise with his students where he got them to take a piece of paper and draw the person who sat next to them , their neighbor , very quickly , just as quickly as they could .
maybe have the same kind of security to play .
thank you . all right .
so we have the finger bla@@ sters . other people have dinosaurs , you know .
yeah , thought so . so we &apos;ve all seen it , haven &apos;t we ?
great . cool . so i was really interested in quanti@@ ty .
so it was a pretty successful evening .
construction play -- it &apos;s playful , obviously , but also a powerful way to learn .
and of course , by the time you get to the average workplace , maybe the best construction tool we have might be the post-@@ it notes . it &apos;s pretty barre@@ n .
we &apos;ve gone through lots of experiences in life , and they provide a strong intuition as to whether an interaction is going to work .
in short , we admi@@ re their wil@@ ling@@ ness to play .
perhaps in conver@@ gent mode we need to be more serious .
reaching success , i was pretty good at coming up with good ideas .
so they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better .
to be more accurate , i wanted to be a pop star .
i had learned to read music by then , or slowly learning to read music .
this is cher@@ y@@ l an@@ g from singa@@ pore .
and i had the same reaction you did .
&quot; my sister and i used to sing in cho@@ irs together constantly .
you can imagine , with 2,000 synchron@@ ized youtube videos , the ren@@ der time is just at@@ ro@@ cious .
this here is n@@ is@@ san &apos;s my@@ leaf , where your driving behavior is compared with the driving behavior of other people , so you can compete for who drives around the most fuel effici@@ ently .
they want us to fit in even better .
and that is an idea that , i think , that paul richard bu@@ chan@@ an nic@@ ely put in a recent es@@ say where he said , &quot; products are vi@@ vid arguments about how we should live our lives . &quot;
workers are treated as well or as badly as the workers were treated who built that chair . &quot;
in fact , i use basically the same technology as this 14@@ th-@@ century classroom .
and i like that kind of response .
so what have we learned ?
so , a quick strike like that . and if we slow it down a bit , this is the man@@ tis shrimp -- the same species -- recorded at 1,000 fra@@ mes a second , played back at 15 fra@@ mes per second .
i hope there aren &apos;t any sna@@ il rights activi@@ sts around here .
it just looks like a sa@@ ddle you &apos;d put on a horse .
in biological systems it &apos;s important not to have a whole lot of extra material requi@@ rements for building it .
the first peak , obviously , is the limb hitting the load cell .
and these animals may very well be making use of not only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring , but the extre@@ mes of the fluid dynamics . and they might actually be making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the sna@@ il .
biologist she@@ ila p@@ ate@@ k talks about her work measuring the feeding strike of the man@@ tis shrimp , one of the fastest movements in the animal world , using video cameras recording at 20,000 fra@@ mes per second .
it turns out that something more than 9@@ 4 percent of life on earth is a@@ qua@@ tic .
now , go into the real atmosphere of this planet .
i put reverse th@@ ru@@ st and i try and pull g@@ ently down .
i come back up , not for air .
so anybody who wants to copy us and come and join us , go for it .
there are problems of se@@ wage over@@ flow and conta@@ mination , but i would also argue that almost every city has this exact condition , and it &apos;s a condition that we &apos;re all facing .
what is fu@@ zzy rope , you ask ?
and the answer is : not yet , they &apos;re working .
we had to get rid of the smell .
and eventually snow made a map of the out@@ break .
so that in one generation , we &apos;re going to hal@@ ve our cultural diversity .
so , two months later , i went into ti@@ bet , and i started intervie@@ wing the people there , taking my photographs . that &apos;s what i do .
this is another leader of his people .
so it was a great experience for him . he stayed up all night with them , dru@@ m@@ ming and dancing .
and just this last year we &apos;ve taken a group of teenagers in , and this has worked the best .
and so , i have my first slide to talk about the da@@ w@@ ning of the universe and what i call the cosmic scene investi@@ gation , that is , looking at the reli@@ cs of creation and in@@ fer@@ ring what happened at the beginning , and then following it up and trying to understand it .
and then i &apos;m going to show you it &apos;s actually a lot more complicated .
and then there &apos;s a part of the universe we can &apos;t see because it &apos;s so dense and so hot , light can &apos;t escape .
they go out and point a telescope at the sky , take a picture , identify what are stars and throw them away , look at the galaxies , estimate how far away they are , and plot them up .
and so now we &apos;re in for some serious play .
so we &apos;re zo@@ om@@ ing in .
so the question is , how hard would it be to assemble this , right ?
that pulls in more material and pulls in more material .
at serious play 2008 , astro@@ physicist george smo@@ ot shows stunning new images from deep@@ -@@ space surve@@ ys , and pro@@ ds us to pon@@ der how the cosmo@@ s -- with its giant we@@ bs of dark matter and mysterious gap@@ ing vo@@ ids -- got built this way .
you get stre@@ ssed , you do some meditation .
we need an exercise . we need a framework to learn how to be more mind@@ ful .
it does hurt . and we rein@@ force the story@@ line , right ?
and he actually took one look at my squi@@ g@@ gly line , and said , &quot; well , why don &apos;t you just embrace the shake ? &quot;
what if i could only create with a dollar &apos;s worth of supplies ?
it did not happen overnight .
so i was fil@@ ming .
and when i made my way to that pi@@ ping chim@@ ney i &apos;d seen in the distance , i saw han@@ na z@@ av@@ or@@ ot@@ n@@ ya , and i met her .
i have a deeper connection to my laptop than any bit of soil .
i em@@ body the central paradox .
parents text and do email at breakfast and at dinner while their children compla@@ in about not having their parents &apos; full attention .
but what might feel just right for that middle-@@ aged execu@@ tive can be a problem for an adolesc@@ ent who needs to develop fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face relationships .
that feeling that no one is listening to me is very important in our relationships with technology .
and we are vulnerable .
so what do we do ? we connect more and more .
make room for it .
let &apos;s talk about how we can use digital technology , the technology of our dreams , to make this life the life we can love .
the master said , &apos; tho@@ u di@@ d@@ st thy best , that is success . &apos; &quot; from those things , and one other perhaps , i co@@ ined my own definition of success , which is : peace of mind at@@ tained only through self-@@ satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you &apos;re capable .
i knew him once , but then he was a boy .
and that &apos;s not good , for a young married man to go home in a bad mood .
i think our tendency is to hope that things will turn out the way we want them to much of the time . but we don &apos;t do the things that are necessary to make those things become reality .
and you can win when you &apos;re out@@ sco@@ red .
i &apos;ve had some that could and wouldn &apos;t , and i &apos;ve had some that would and couldn &apos;t .
in fact , in the last 10 years , the number of patients requ@@ ir@@ ing an organ has doubled , while in the same time , the actual number of trans@@ plants has barely gone up .
liver cells , nerve cells , pan@@ crea@@ tic cells -- we still can &apos;t grow them even today .
we then place it in an o@@ ven@@ -like device , and we &apos;re able to create that structure and bring it out .
and then finally you &apos;re able to get that structure out .
that &apos;s actually the actual printer right now , and that &apos;s been printing this kidney structure that you see here .
i became the cap@@ tain of the team , and that was great .
i pulled them aside .
the other week , i went on one of these sites , appropri@@ ately called swa@@ p@@ tree , and there were over 5@@ 9@@ ,@@ 300 items that i could instantly swa@@ p for my copy of &quot; 24 . &quot;
that &apos;s what happened to me when i noticed that we are moving from passive consumers to cre@@ ators , to highly enabled collabor@@ ators .
these four drivers are f@@ using together and creating the big shift -- away from the 20th century , defined by hyper@@ -@@ consumption , towards the 21st century , defined by collaborative consumption .
these three systems are coming together , allowing people to share resources without sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ ing their life@@ sty@@ les , or their ch@@ eri@@ shed personal fre@@ ed@@ oms .
this is fu@@ eling a massive shift from where u@@ sage tru@@ mps posse@@ ssions -- or as kevin kel@@ ly , the editor of wired magazine , puts it , &quot; where access is better than ownership . &quot;
my name is joseph , a member of parliament in kenya .
the leader of the chi@@ efs said , &quot; no , sorry . we can &apos;t take you . you &apos;ll slow us down .
i &apos;m asking my friends from america to help with bringing nurses or doctors to help us out .
so i was in the museum of science at the time the tor@@ na@@ do hit , playing with the tor@@ na@@ do display .
co : you got my number off the news ?
systems like the ones that we were creating on the fly could exist ahead of time .
mo : data .
in our hometown , we trained a half-@@ dozen residents to run these web tools on their own .
and i met ju@@ li@@ us the last week that i was living in ki@@ ber@@ a .
&apos;@@ in case you o@@ we one month , the land@@ lord will come with his hen@@ ch@@ men and bun@@ dle you out . he will confi@@ s@@ cate your things , &apos; ar@@ m@@ strong said .
this is perhaps the most primitive sh@@ an@@ ty that you can find in ki@@ ber@@ a , little more than a sti@@ ck@@ -and-@@ mud hu@@ t next to a garbage hea@@ p .
it &apos;s on very ste@@ ep ground .
one is people need a guarantee they won &apos;t be ev@@ ic@@ ted .
the future of these communities is in the people and in our ability to work with those people .
i don &apos;t know where ju@@ lian mor@@ row got that from .
see it up there ?
one is another american inventor ted h@@ enter .
many websites we can &apos;t read using ja@@ ws and the other technologies .
i think i have to say goodbye now .
interestingly enough , other neuro@@ logic diseases which affect very different parts of the brain also show tan@@ g@@ les of mis@@ folded protein , which suggests that the approach might be a general one , and might be used to cure many neuro@@ logic diseases , not just alzheimer &apos;s disease .
i &apos;m going to ignore their cau@@ tions and make one very specific fore@@ cast .
so this is a time of great flouri@@ shing , and the more i look around , the more convinced i become that this quote , from the physicist free@@ man dy@@ son , is not hyper@@ bo@@ le at all .
and to make them really stereoty@@ pical , let &apos;s make them both white guys .
and if you find yourself worried that something like a guaran@@ te@@ ed income is going to sti@@ f@@ le our drive to succeed and make us kind of com@@ plac@@ ent , you might be interested to know that social mobility , one of the things we really pride ourselves on in the united states , is now lower than it is in the northern european countries that have these very generous social safety nets .
the re@@ alities of this new machine age and the change in the economy are becoming more widely known .
i have become more and more uncomfortable with this perception of god over the years .
some have conclu@@ ded that we can only believe in a god who shares our pain .
in the second verse comes the line , &quot; the wind and waves obe@@ y him . &quot;
so who is god , if not the great puppe@@ t-@@ master or the tri@@ bal prote@@ ctor ?
what if god is in things ?
how could one practice such a faith ?
and so , i want to kind of go through my little story of what i found out .
and if we study those hun@@ ter-@@ gather@@ er tribes and the neander@@ thal , which are very similar to early man , we find out a very curious thing about this world without technology , and this is a kind of a curve of their average age .
it was sort of , in a certain sense , in a m@@ clu@@ han sense , an external stomach , in the sense that it was cooking food that we could not eat otherwise .
while this is something that comes from our mind , it also has its roots deeply into the cosmo@@ s .
it &apos;s a bran@@ ching off from the human form .
i think that really leads nowhere .
that &apos;s what we get from technology all the time . that &apos;s why people leave villages and go into cities , is because they are always gravit@@ ating towards increased choices and possibilities .
meanwhile , i had grown up around a lot of teachers .
so the idea was that we would be working on whatever we &apos;re working on , at 2 : 30 p.@@ m. the students flow in and you put down what you &apos;re doing , or you trade , or you work a little bit later or whatever it is .
that was just my one thing -- i said we had to have something that drops on people &apos;s heads .
and we found ourselves full every day with kids .
the key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a month , those two hours shoul@@ der@@ -to-@@ shoulder , next to one student , concentrated attention , shining this beam of light on their work , on their thoughts and their self-@@ expression , is going to be absolutely transformative , because so many of the students have not had that ever before .
they work under the teacher &apos;s guide , and it &apos;s all in one big room .
and so then they &apos;re all sold in the store . this is near the plan@@ ks .
they didn &apos;t want to sell pir@@ ate supplies .
so this is the space during tu@@ tor@@ ing hours .
anyway . so i &apos;m going to jump ahead .
the schools need you . the teachers need you .
you see , i grew up in war@@ -@@ tor@@ n iraq , and i believe that there are two sides of wars and we &apos;ve only seen one side of it .
this is where we concei@@ ve of rape and ca@@ su@@ al@@ ties as inevit@@ abilities .
there is a side that fi@@ ghts , and there is a side that keeps the schools and the factories and the hospitals open .
a con@@ go@@ le@@ se woman , who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her raped in front of them and mu@@ til@@ ated in front of them , and her children saw their nine@@ -year-old sib@@ ling killed in front of them , how they &apos;re doing okay right now .
z@@ a@@ in@@ a@@ b sal@@ bi : women , war@@ time and the dream of peace
and she has this show , &quot; the simple life . &quot;
last month , i was at google , and , boy , that ca@@ fe@@ ter@@ ia , man .
and she &apos;s very important in my life , because she &apos;s the one that told me to leave mit and go to art school .
so if you compare comple@@ xi@@ ties to simplicity , it &apos;s also catching up in a way , too .
and when you &apos;re told this , you feel kind of weird .
so , i went back to the computer , and i bought five large fri@@ es , and scan@@ ned them all . and i was looking for some kind of food theme , and i wrote some software to automatically lay out fren@@ ch@@ -@@ f@@ ry images .
it &apos;s a bit e@@ eri@@ e , isn &apos;t it ?
this book i wrote because i want to figure out life .
and this is the fourth time , and i come here for this wisdom , i think .
environmental challenges fall into the same three categories , and most of what we think about are local environmental problems : air pollution , water pollution , ha@@ zar@@ d@@ ous waste du@@ mps . but there are also regi@@ onal environmental problems , like acid rain from the mid@@ west to the nor@@ theast , and from western europe to the arctic , and from the mid@@ west out the missi@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i into the dead zone of the gulf of mexico .
you all know that . at the last i@@ p@@ c@@ c sum@@ mary , the scientists wanted to say , &quot; how certain are you ? &quot; they wanted to answer that &quot; 99 percent . &quot;
we have to have a uni@@ fied view of how to go about this : the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions , all has a single , very simple solution .
what we need is another hero generation . those of us who are alive in the united states of america today especially , but also the rest of the world , have to somehow understand that history has presented us with a choice -- just as j@@ ill &#91; bol@@ te &#93; ta@@ yl@@ or was figuring out how to save her life while she was distr@@ acted by the amazing experience that she was going through .
so they &apos;re saying the right things and they may -- whi@@ che@@ ver of them is elected -- may do the right thing , but let me tell you : when i came back from k@@ yo@@ to in 199@@ 7 , with a feeling of great happiness that we &apos;d gotten that breakthrough there , and then confron@@ ted the united states sen@@ ate , only one out of 100 sen@@ ators was willing to vote to con@@ firm , to rati@@ fy that treat@@ y . whatever the candidates say has to be laid al@@ ong@@ side what the people say .
a change in commitment . a new sense of ur@@ gency .
and this exhibition is about the work of designers that help us be more el@@ astic , and also of designers that really work on this el@@ as@@ tic@@ ity as an opportunity . and one last thing is that it &apos;s not only designers , but it &apos;s also scientists .
he &apos;s thinking -- of course it &apos;s all a concept -- of inje@@ cting ty@@ pe@@ faces into s@@ per@@ mat@@ o@@ zo@@ a , i don &apos;t know how to say it in english -- s@@ per@@ mat@@ a@@ zo@@ i -- in order to make them become -- to almost have a song or a whole poem written with every e@@ j@@ acu@@ lation .
in this particular case a section will be de@@ voted to information design .
rapid manufacturing is a computer file sent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine .
another shape is made for cancer .
and many designers have been working recently on the idea of death and m@@ our@@ ning , and what we can do about it today with new technologies .
we did it in three steps .
and the same pattern emerged in each conflict .
so what &apos;s going on ?
the opposite happened .
and within jewish teach@@ ings , the rab@@ bin@@ ic teach@@ ings , we have hil@@ le@@ l , who taught that you shouldn &apos;t do to others what you don &apos;t like being done to yourself .
and then god looked to the future and realized , if the world was created just with justice , the world couldn &apos;t exist .
and that unity is something that connects all of creation .
and he ru@@ shed home . and after the sab@@ bath , he made 12 lo@@ a@@ ves of bread , took them to the sy@@ na@@ go@@ gue , went into the sy@@ na@@ go@@ gue , opened the ar@@ k and said , &quot; god , i don &apos;t know why you want this bread , but here you are . &quot;
and he called the two of them to his office .
it persi@@ sts for months and of@@ t@@ enti@@ mes for years , and when that happens , it is its own disease .
but the worst part was , not the spon@@ taneous pain that was there 24 hours a day .
we treat these patients in a rather cru@@ de fashion at this point in time .
if you look out your window and you can see long &apos;s peak , you &apos;re probably familiar with it .
so it &apos;s about a mile across , 600 feet deep .
let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosa@@ ur@@ -@@ killer for 65 million years . they &apos;re very rare .
now the good news is that the odds of it actually passing through this key@@ hole and hitting us next go@@ -@@ around are one in a million , roughly -- very , very low odds , so i personally am not lying a@@ wake at night worrying about this at all .
and there are a lot of other problems with that . it &apos;s very hard to do .
this probe actually can &apos;t use chemical rockets .
so i thought that it will be good to start with it .
and we all had all of that on ta@@ pes .
it &apos;s so obvious , straight in your face , and somebody must have thought of it .
you see banks -- i don &apos;t know if there are any ban@@ kers over here ; i apologi@@ ze in advance -- but it &apos;s the best job in the world .
just quickly on the results .
he goes and sees the gover@@ nor . the gover@@ nor says , bor@@ is ni@@ ko@@ lay@@ ev@@ ich , i understand you are doing a great job , and you are the most respe@@ cted newspaper in our district .
because when you think about the importance , some of the issues that we were talking about last night -- this last session we had about africa and his hypothe@@ tical 50 billion dollars dest@@ ined for africa .
now we do day@@ dre@@ aming in 11 : 30 with 55 seconds left .
what happens to matter if you cho@@ p it up very fine ?
and suppose they have , you know , very different sensory appar@@ at@@ us , and so on .
and in a lot of familiar cases , they of course are .
it &apos;s a very simple example .
now , here is a very exciting development that many people have not heard of .
it &apos;s the same theory of gravity .
presu@@ ma@@ bly , they mean something super@@ natural .
how true for lincoln .
so then he surprised the nation with an upset vic@@ tory for the presi@@ dency over three far more experienced , far more educated , far more celebrated ri@@ v@@ als .
but even in his wil@@ dest dreams , lincoln could never have imagined how far his reputation would reach .
but it was not to be that simple .
a vic@@ tor in a thousand con@@ tests , three great civil rights laws , medi@@ care , aid to education .
one of his favorite stories , for example , had to do with the rev@@ olutionary war hero , e@@ than all@@ en .
and i was so excited -- first person i &apos;d ever see outside of e@@ b@@ be@@ ts field .
but luckily , my first conf@@ es@@ sion -- to a base@@ b@@ all-@@ loving pri@@ est !
and i want to begin with one episo@@ de from that sequence of events that most of you would be very familiar with , bel@@ sha@@ zz@@ ar &apos;s fe@@ ast -- because we &apos;re talking about the ir@@ an-@@ iraq war of 5@@ 3@@ 9 bc .
and what is the great king , the powerful king , the king of the four quarters of the world going to do ?
it was the largest empire the world had known until then .
no other evidence .
and equally , he &apos;d have been surprised that he was acting under orders from mar@@ du@@ k .
they want to bor@@ row the cyrus cylinder .
and i want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures .
and it &apos;s only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children .
for those without dis@@ abilities , at age three , they &apos;re trans@@ fer@@ red to another institution , and at age seven , to yet another . se@@ gre@@ gated according to age and gender , they are ar@@ bit@@ r@@ arily separated from their si@@ blin@@ gs , often without even a chance to say goodbye .
people need to know the harm that institutions cause to children , and the better alter@@ natives that exist .
because it &apos;s obviously incredibly frightening .
and that &apos;s why we wanted it to be the 21st of september as the date of peace .
and just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empower@@ ing actually .
it didn &apos;t matter if it didn &apos;t create a day of peace .
and i remember thinking , &quot; this is exactly why , actually , we have to work even harder .
it was historical . could it work in afghanistan with un@@ ama and who and civil society , etc . , etc . , etc . ?
and we did , and we traveled around , and we spoke to el@@ ders , we spoke to doctors , we spoke to nurses , we held press confer@@ ences , we went out with soldiers , we sat down with isa@@ f , we sat down with na@@ to , we sat down with the u.k. government .
and we gave the film over .
ultimately , that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . &quot;
it &apos;s about your constitu@@ encies ; it &apos;s about your businesses .
but let &apos;s play along .
so this to me became the important question to answer : how many neurons does the human brain have , and how does that compare to other animals ?
compared to a rat , we might seem special , yes , but that &apos;s not a fair comparison to make , given that we know that we are not ro@@ dents .
when you eat like a primate , you can &apos;t afford both .
and i think that &apos;s how we got to become human .
i &apos;m fascinated with the idea of what happens when you mer@@ ge biology with technology , and i remember reading about this idea of being able to re@@ program biology , in the future , away from disease and aging .
it &apos;s a very logical plan , but it was not always like this .
but one day , something happened .
the man , his name was ma@@ h@@ mou@@ d , and the child , whose name was ra@@ fi , left .
it &apos;s not a priority . &quot;
the stu@@ mp or cast pros@@ thesis was made , and he was starting the real physical rehabil@@ itation .
no need of staying with me all the day pushing my wheelchair . &quot;
i don &apos;t want them to be te@@ ased at school by the other students . &quot;
but with na@@ j@@ mu@@ dd@@ in , we cannot discuss .
they are 7@@ ,000 every year -- people coming for the first time .
this is my big wish .
i want to tell you some stories that explain my view .
their decisions , their actions matter .
what lessons would you take from an experience like this ?
and i was part of that .
now , i was a little scared because when you see those three problems , they seem really hard to deal with .
and he signs off , &quot; thank you . &quot;
it says a lot about her peers who elected her .
can you see it ?
so when we want to learn whether a planet is habit@@ able , whether it might be am@@ enable to life , we want to know not only how much total light it recei@@ ves and how warm it is , but we want to know about its space weather -- this high-@@ energy radiation , the u@@ v and the x-@@ rays that are created by its star and that ba@@ the it in this bath of high-@@ energy radiation .
wrong . i &apos;m not looking at you . i can &apos;t see you .
but there exists out there a very large population of people who will tell you that they have psych@@ ic , magical powers that they can predict the future , that they can make contact with the dece@@ ased .
she doesn &apos;t bring any useful information to us .
&quot; did he ever have an electric raz@@ or ? &quot; &quot; no . &quot;
now , without that , how could we possibly function ?
she couldn &apos;t reach me . now she says she doesn &apos;t want to reach me because i &apos;m a go@@ dless person .
now folks , this is not just a metaphor i &apos;m going to give you now , it &apos;s true .
those are very important , cri@@ tically important to us .
le@@ gen@@ dary skep@@ tic james rand@@ i takes a fat@@ al dose of home@@ op@@ ath@@ ic sleeping pills onstage , kic@@ king off a sear@@ ing 18@@ -@@ minute indi@@ ct@@ ment of ir@@ rational beliefs . he thro@@ ws out a challenge to the world &apos;s psych@@ ics : prove what you do is real , and i &apos;ll give you a million dollars .
so it runs frequently , the entire hospital , just on a gener@@ ator .
there has to be something better . &quot;
but this gives control to the provi@@ der , whether there &apos;s power or not , because they can adjust the flow based on the percentage of oxygen they see that they &apos;re giving their patient .
but we still want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can be putting into hospitals .
some lo@@ gos designed by my students .
the creative spirit in africa , the creative tradition , is as potent as it has always been , if only designers could look within .
it &apos;s a ho@@ lo@@ cau@@ st of a different kind , and hiding under our des@@ ks isn &apos;t going to help .
now , there &apos;s no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here , but the evidence is that plants -- and i want to make this clear -- it &apos;s not the ingredients in plants , it &apos;s the plants .
half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to agri@@ business .
mar@@ gar@@ ine didn &apos;t exist .
the effects of this are well known . they are everywhere .
most mom@@ s coo@@ ked like mine : a piece of bro@@ iled meat , a quickly made sal@@ ad with bot@@ tled dre@@ ssing , can@@ ned soup , can@@ ned fruit sal@@ ad .
leading the way -- what &apos;s leading the way ?
and i say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of cor@@ ned be@@ ef in his life .
we can continue the search for the ingredients we love , and we can continue to spin y@@ ar@@ ns about our favorite meals .
sound familiar ?
if i can ask an in@@ dis@@ cre@@ et question , how many of you have tat@@ to@@ os ?
myth number two : or@@ phe@@ us , wonderful guy , char@@ ming to be around , great parti@@ er , great singer , lo@@ ses his be@@ loved , char@@ ms his way into the under@@ world , only person to char@@ m his way into the under@@ world , char@@ ms the gods of the under@@ world , they release his beauty on the condition he never look at her until they &apos;re out .
some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers , which is encouraging .
5@@ 2 million people die of natural causes each year correspon@@ ds , then , to 5@@ 2 million volu@@ mes destroyed .
if we were to take into account future generations that will never come into existence if we blow ourselves up , then the figure becomes astronom@@ ical .
we were very successful .
so if you think about what it means to learn arith@@ metic or to learn to read , you &apos;re actually , literally re@@ writing your own brain .
and they would just st@@ are at us with ba@@ ff@@ lement when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance , like the one we just heard -- because of people making stupid movements , and they would be really ir@@ rit@@ ated and wouldn &apos;t see what we were up to .
so then , you move off to this larger sphere of &quot; human + , &quot; and you could continue that process and eventually explore a lot of this larger space of possible mo@@ des of being .
ts : those are permanent magne@@ ts , yeah .
ts : yeah , well let &apos;s put a couple of canv@@ ases .
and then when i did the second one , it really distur@@ bed the piece -- these big blue lines cra@@ shing through the center of it -- and so it created a kind of tension and an over@@ lap .
you know , it seems at this stage in your life , you also very personally are in this state of confron@@ tation with a sort of diss@@ on@@ ant -- i suppose it &apos;s an electro@@ magnetic force that somehow gover@@ ns your parkinson &apos;s and this creative force that is both the artist who is in the here and now and this sort of ar@@ c of your whole life .
ts : thank you , john .
my mother comes out , and he asks her for money , but she doesn &apos;t have enough .
i grew up in the middle of nowhere on a dirt road in rural ar@@ kansas , an hour from the nearest movie theater .
one of them , i call my mi@@ ma@@ w &apos;s test .
i &apos;m under the river with those fish .
one of these is scrat@@ ch@@ -@@ off master@@ pieces .
what he did was to get wild birds to make his art for him .
and so we got to the grave and made this , which was hil@@ ari@@ ous -- the attention that we got .
and also they reference how the u@@ vul@@ a -- everything they say is fallen because of the forbi@@ dden fruit .
he &apos;s an austr@@ alian ab@@ original el@@ der , and he &apos;s also an artist .
and you would think that should have nothing to do with one another , but i hope by the end of these 18 minutes , you &apos;ll see a little bit of a relation .
and what changed is something you might not have expected in an art , which is math .
and if you don &apos;t want to fold 400 scales , you can back off and just do a few things , and add plates to the back of a tur@@ tle , or toes .
we &apos;re going to learn how to make one fla@@ p .
and i can use those patterns now to create origami shapes .
toes have become an origami meme , because everyone &apos;s doing it .
they certainly didn &apos;t need to talk to origami artists .
the problem that &apos;s being solved here is something that needs to be big and she@@ e@@ t-@@ like at its destination , but needs to be small for the journey .
for@@ rest north : the beginning of any collaboration starts with a conversation .
he came up with our name and logo . we &apos;re mission motors .
the 200@@ ,000-@@ year period in which men have been top dog is truly coming to an end , believe it or not , and that &apos;s why i talk about the &quot; end of men . &quot;
and so they decided , because they were intrigu@@ ed by this finding , to do a nation@@ wide survey .
but that really isn &apos;t true anymore .
and what &apos;s even more distur@@ bing is what &apos;s happening with younger boys .
and i think the reason it has a sting is because thousands of years of history don &apos;t reverse themselves without a lot of pain , and that &apos;s why i talk about us all going through this together .
but over the &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s , the south korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industri@@ alize , and so what they did was , they started to push women into the workforce .
and we have a lot of skill and experience , but it &apos;s a trick , so how are you supposed to prepare to get through that glass ceiling ?
and the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting .
and it &apos;s interesting , if you think about it , how , when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pin@@ n@@ ac@@ les of human achievement -- whether it &apos;s china , gree@@ ce , the h@@ ind@@ u civilization , or the may@@ as , or egyp@@ ti@@ ans -- what we know about them is really about their ec@@ sta@@ si@@ es , not about their everyday life .
whether it &apos;s mathematics or music , it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it &apos;s better than what was there before .
you know that what you need to do is possible to do , even though difficult , and sense of time disappears , you forget yourself , you feel part of something larger .
even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow , but that &apos;s when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get feedback from it .
and if &quot; where do you come from ? &quot;
and the number of us who live outside the old na@@ tion-@@ state categories is increasing so quickly , by 6@@ 4 million just in the last 12 years , that soon there will be more of us than there are americans .
and yet , there is one great problem with movement , and that is that it &apos;s really hard to get your be@@ ar@@ ings when you &apos;re in mi@@ da@@ ir .
and i sat down , and i began to write , and write , and write , even though i &apos;d gone there really to get away from my desk .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future , but i will not use digital technology , as i &apos;ve done during my first five tedtalks .
and the most successful of the developing countries , they have moved on , you know , and they have become emerging economies , we call them .
will they move on ?
the whole emerging world jo@@ ins the western world with good child survival and small family size , but we still have the poorest billion .
the world &apos;s population will grow to 9 billion over the next 50 years -- and only by raising the living standards of the poorest can we check population growth . this is the parado@@ x@@ ical answer that hans ro@@ sling un@@ ve@@ ils at ted @ can@@ n@@ es using color@@ ful new data display technology .
we are left with this missing space of increased deaths the further north you go .
and i started doing research , and we found , very exc@@ it@@ ingly , that the skin produces nit@@ ric oxide .
now , what we were careful to do was , vitam@@ in d is made by ultra@@ violet b rays and we wanted to separate our story from the vitam@@ in d story .
there is no change in blood flow , in di@@ lat@@ ation of the blood vessels .
and this is ongoing work , but der@@ mat@@ ologists -- i mean , i &apos;m a der@@ mat@@ ologist .
these are major issues .
so , your body is constantly re@@ generating .
it di@@ sin@@ te@@ gr@@ ates a few months later .
and this is an x-ray showing you the patent , functional blood vessel .
but there are other hol@@ low organs that have added complexity to it .
another strategy that we have followed is actually to use de@@ cell@@ ul@@ ar@@ ized organs .
we are limited with distances right now , but our goal is actually to increase those distances over time .
he finally stops the run@@ away stage .
i would be willing to bet that i &apos;m the du@@ m@@ best guy in the room because i couldn &apos;t get through school . i stru@@ gg@@ led with school .
what we do is we sit and teach our kids all the things they shouldn &apos;t do : don &apos;t hit ; don &apos;t bite ; don &apos;t sw@@ ear .
all three of the foun@@ ders of net@@ scape had it .
is it thing one or thing two ? what is it ?
and i remember this one customer so vi@@ vi@@ dly because i also did some other stuff with these clients .
i also learned , don &apos;t reveal your source , because i got beat up after about four weeks of doing this because one of the rich kids found out where i was buying my comics from , and he didn &apos;t like the fact that he was paying a lot more .
and you could stuff p@@ ins in them .
then i would go up and deliver them to these 7@@ 0-@@ year-old women playing bridge .
that was cool because then i had re@@ tail out@@ lets .
and then they don &apos;t have a regular check , but they have more opportunities to find more stuff , and they learn the skill of negoti@@ ating , and they learn the skill of finding opportunities as well .
if you go into a restaurant and you have bad customer service , show them what bad customer service looks like .
it &apos;s a video that was done by one of the companies that i mentor .
we have even managed to make the study of literature ar@@ cane .
a har@@ rowing predi@@ lec@@ tion for the uses of force had become common@@ place , with an equal di@@ sta@@ ste for the alternative forms of influence .
but structures designed to connect , rather than divide mu@@ tually dependent circles , rather than isol@@ ating tri@@ angles .
the most important discovery we made in our focus on public action was to appreciate that the hard choices are not between good and evil , but between competing goods .
president obama and his team simply cannot do it alone .
okay , see ? it &apos;s done . it &apos;s almost done . here we go .
they recognize : both of these things have to live together .
they are acting in the sense that they &apos;re e@@ mul@@ ating the original ma@@ sh@@ up .
in the good old days when this republi@@ can ran that company , their greatest work was work that built on the past , right .
now , i think there are lessons we should learn here , lessons about openness .
you could still buy the music , but you couldn &apos;t hear anything because it had been sil@@ enced .
anyway , please join me in teaching these values .
if you don &apos;t say the right creative thing , you &apos;re going to be jud@@ ged .
and something else happened , these people who went through the process and touched the sna@@ ke ended up having less anxiety about other things in their lives .
about that time he was at the d.@@ school at stanford taking classes .
so while you &apos;re sitting around with the other patients in your pa@@ jam@@ as and everybody &apos;s p@@ ale and thin and you &apos;re waiting for your turn to get the gam@@ ma rays , you think of a lot of things .
thank you .
let &apos;s take a look at what &apos;s going on in different space types in this building .
when he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study in a quanti@@ tative way how his design choices imp@@ acted the ecology and biology of this building , he got really excited , because it added a new dimension to what he did .
so let &apos;s just run through these guys .
the system was designed to au@@ gment human intelligence , it was called .
these are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s .
and according to fortune magazine , he &apos;s worth 700 million dollars .
in fact , someone on re@@ dd@@ it thought , &quot; oh , what a great thing , we should all vote this up . &quot;
they even created an e-@@ card so you could send your friend a dancing sp@@ la@@ shy .
i am a native of bur@@ kin@@ a fa@@ so .
fundra@@ ising was not an easy task .
and for me and my community , this project was a huge success .
i would like to share with you this .
yes , you know it .
and when you look through them , you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber@@ -@@ illu@@ sion@@ ist .
voice : don &apos;t tell , or it won &apos;t come true .
digital mt : this is without a question the real thing .
now the big question here is obviously , how do we make sense of china ?
the first is that the most important political value for the chinese is unity , is the ma@@ inten@@ ance of chinese civilization .
the chinese have a very , very different con@@ ception of race to most other countries .
it &apos;s had no serious ri@@ v@@ als .
so there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is china -- the civiliz@@ a@@ tion-@@ state , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society .
first , the west is rapidly losing its influence in the world .
now this is the way things are going to move , because china has a very specific problem , which is different from europe and different from the united states : china has huge numbers of people and no space .
red = dru@@ ms , blue = bas@@ s , green = chor@@ ds , orange = leads , purple = pa@@ ds the mou@@ th@@ piece consi@@ sts of ...
it &apos;s been eight years , and i can tell you that i didn &apos;t go to china to become a lawyer .
&#91; chinese &#93; &quot; big sister w@@ ong , &quot; wash@@ burn , w@@ ong , same difference .
what about art ?
everyone was glu@@ ed to the tv , watching distur@@ bing , frightening images taken from the edge of the neighborhood .
when we got there , we just went in the street , started talking with people everywhere , and we realized that things were a bit different from the rhe@@ tor@@ ic we heard in the media .
people come around us and start asking , &quot; what are you doing here ? &quot;
i just observed .
then the next day , i held a meeting on the main square and some women came .
we went to africa , su@@ dan , si@@ erra le@@ one , lib@@ eria , kenya .
you know what i love is , for example , when you see the biggest eye there , there are so &#91; many &#93; houses inside .
for each project we do a film .
but yesterday the city called them and said , &quot; look , you &apos;re going to have to tear it down .
actually the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neutral place for ex@@ changes and discus@@ sions , and then enables you to change the world .
and we come from a long tradition of sharing .
one of the foun@@ ders went to switzerland , saw it imple@@ mented some@@ place , said , &quot; wow , that looks really cool .
the number across the u.s. and western europe is eight percent .
so here we have lu@@ dot@@ r@@ uck , which is in l.a. , doing the things that g@@ our@@ met food trucks do , and they &apos;ve gathered quite a following .
super fun , and it happens in a very transi@@ tional neighborhood .
the future , as we know it , is very un@@ predictable .
we &apos;ve seen it in the financial crisis . we &apos;ve seen it in the pandemic flu .
but will this only be available for the super rich , for those that can afford it ? are we headed for a new eu@@ gen@@ ics ?
an individual , for the first time in the history of humanity , will have the capacity , by 20@@ 30 , to destroy the planet , to wre@@ ck everything , through the creation , for example , of a bi@@ opa@@ tho@@ gen .
i &apos;m not on top of the class .
but , most importantly , while i was traveling , i taught children carto@@ oning , and in exchange , i learned how to be spon@@ taneous .
i was h@@ es@@ it@@ ant to include this in my presentation because this cartoon was published soon after 9 / 11 .
everything had to be larger . the next painting was even bigger .
this is a work , a library i designed for the ro@@ bin hood foundation .
so then i said , &quot; nets , what do i do ? &quot;
we had fashion designers , installation artists , models , we had ma@@ ke@@ up artists , jewel@@ ry designers , all kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation .
my works also turned auto@@ bio@@ graphical .
you know i sat at home and i watched .
and i drew it out for her .
e : ac@@ ho@@ o !
can you get down ?
because one of her favorite folks from back home is here , and she &apos;s pretty nervous to meet him .
e : qu@@ ack , qu@@ ack , qu@@ ack .
sw : you are very special . what would you like to say to all these nice people ?
and on one particular day , the cam@@ pers were ju@@ mping through inner tubes , they were diving through inner tubes . and i thought this would be great fun .
i started seeking out tri@@ athle@@ tes because i found that li@@ fel@@ ong swim@@ mers often couldn &apos;t teach what they did .
the head is held in line with the sp@@ ine , so that you use strategic water pressure to raise your legs up -- very important , especially for people with lower body fat .
so i thought why not pun@@ ish myself ? i &apos;ll do japanese .
and that set me on this panic driven search for the perfect language method .
and so i ended up walking like this .
i interviewed these people because they all taught in bu@@ en@@ os ai@@ res .
that &apos;s just one benefit of that .
what i want to talk about today is one idea .
now not surprisingly , that influenced some people to think we were onto something .
ge@@ off mul@@ gan : a short in@@ tr@@ o to the studio school
and the phi@@ list@@ ine who is sent down , their mi@@ gh@@ ty warri@@ or , is a giant .
so david , in that story , is supposed to be the under@@ dog , right ?
if you go back over the history of ancient war@@ fare , you will find time and time again that s@@ lin@@ gers were the deci@@ sive factor against inf@@ an@@ try in one kind of battle or another .
and then there &apos;s this whole weird thing about how long it takes go@@ li@@ ath to react to the sight of david .
and that would also explain so much of what was strange about his behavior that day .
and something fe@@ stered inside me after this happened .
we have millions of genes of microbes in our human micro@@ biom@@ e covering us .
and so , these studies have documented or suggested out of a variety of important functions for the microbial community , this cloud , the non-@@ patho@@ gens that live in and on us .
we should treat it carefully and with respect , and we do not want to mess with it , say by c@@ -@@ sections or by antibiotics or exc@@ es@@ sive clean@@ lin@@ ess , without some real good justi@@ fication .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing . so wikipedia -- you just saw the little demonstration of it -- it &apos;s a freely licen@@ sed encyclopedia . it &apos;s written by thousands of volunteers all over the world in many , many languages .
and he &apos;s only been our employe@@ e since january 2005 , all the other growth before that .
the media has covered this somewhat exten@@ sively .
we should merely report on what repu@@ table parties have said about it .
these are the people who are doing the bul@@ k of the site , and they are , in a sense , se@@ mi@@ -@@ professionals at what they &apos;re doing , that the standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality .
so somebody says , &quot; de@@ lete it , please . de@@ lete it -- it &apos;s not no@@ table . &quot;
and i also like to say she &apos;s the only person who actually knows all the rules of wikipedia , so ...
ben sa@@ un@@ ders : yeah , hi , ben sa@@ un@@ ders .
i and my colleagues art ar@@ on and luc@@ y brown and others , have put 37 people who are ma@@ dly in love into a functional mri brain scanner .
almost nobody gets out of love alive .
we found activity in a tiny , little factory near the base of the brain called the ven@@ tr@@ al te@@ g@@ mental area .
two thousand years later , we can explain this in the brain .
i &apos;ve also come to believe that romantic love is an addi@@ ction : a perfectly wonderful addi@@ ction when it &apos;s going well , and a perfectly horrible addi@@ ction when it &apos;s going po@@ or@@ ly .
our ne@@ west experiment has been hat@@ ched by my colleague , art ar@@ on -- putting people who are reporting that they are still in love , in a long-term relationship , into the functional mri .
so , i will close with this . these are my older people .
i &apos;m not quite sure .
three : sin@@ e@@ w used in the outer layer of the limb for maximum tension storage .
d@@ ong wo@@ o jan@@ g : the art of bo@@ w@@ -making
and like all the dolphins in our community , we photographed mu@@ g@@ sy and trac@@ ked her little spots and nic@@ ks in her dor@@ sal f@@ in , and also the unique spot patterns as she mat@@ ured over time .
and they use these bur@@ st-@@ pul@@ sed sounds as well as their head-@@ to-@@ head behaviors when they &apos;re fighting .
this underwater keyboard in or@@ lan@@ do , florida , at the ep@@ co@@ t center , was actually the most sophisticated ever two-@@ way interface designed for humans and dolphins to work together under the water and exchange information .
the di@@ ver here has a rope toy , and i &apos;m on the keyboard on the left , and i &apos;ve just played the rope key , and that &apos;s the request for the toy from the human .
the dolphin &apos;s at the keyboard .
den@@ ise her@@ zing : could we speak the language of dolphins ?
it &apos;s based on an ar@@ gent@@ ini@@ an rhythm called &quot; car@@ ni@@ v@@ ali@@ to . &quot;
comment@@ ator : there he is .
so the idea was , okay , keep that feeling of freedom , but change the ve@@ ctor and increase the time .
because this is -- i &apos;m quite an experienced man@@ ager of systems as a pilot , but this is really -- you need flu@@ id@@ ity , you need to be a@@ gile and also to adapt really fast .
so i did try to take , again , a climb altitude .
with that , i have to adapt to something new .
y@@ r : i have a standard answer .
i bet those pre@@ historic cave artists would have loved to know how to draw better .
wor@@ ry@@ ingly , there is no consen@@ sus about what it is .
we don &apos;t see those nuclear reactions in stars .
so we perceive nothing as what it really is .
why a marriage contract and not any other reason for regular annual action ?
it &apos;s the basic regul@@ ating principle of the enlighten@@ ment .
so this little slide here shows you an op@@ tom@@ e@@ tri@@ st and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people and that &apos;s the ratio in the u.k .
i have a global vision for vision .
i have to say , it wasn &apos;t exactly what i had in mind for my first day down under .
so , the new festiv@@ al , it asks the audience to play an essential role in sha@@ ping the performance .
case in point : when &quot; the sul@@ tan &apos;s elephant &quot; came to london just nine months after 7 / 7 , a lon@@ don@@ er wrote , &quot; for the first time since the london bomb@@ ings , my daughter called up with that spar@@ kle back in her voice .
&#91; &quot; academy award winner for visual effects &quot; &#93; second doctor : welcome to your new body , ja@@ ke@@ .@@ first doctor : good .
and what these images are -- you &apos;ll see them at the start of the slide show -- there &apos;s only about four images -- but it &apos;s of a little bear that lives in the great bear rainforest .
after a while of reading this in the news , it just becomes news .
but unfortunately , 95 percent of the gl@@ aci@@ ers in the arctic are also re@@ ce@@ ding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not inje@@ cting any ice back into the ecosystem .
after an hour in these conditions , it &apos;s so extreme that , when i go down , almost every dive i v@@ om@@ it into my regul@@ ator because my body can &apos;t deal with the stress of the cold on my head .
when i &apos;m on my dea@@ th@@ bed , i &apos;m going to remember one story more than any other .
it just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn &apos;t have hands -- it &apos;s going to take a little bite , the boat po@@ ps , and off they go .
i put my fli@@ p@@ pers on . i could barely part my li@@ ps .
this just didn &apos;t happen a couple of times .
it &apos;s a story that lives deep in my heart , and i &apos;m proud to share this with you .
now that you &apos;re done looking at those , close them down , because every phone has something in common .
now , instead of doing it like mis@@ direction and throwing it off to the side , instead , what i choose to focus on is frank , to be able to play with the frank inside your head , your little security guard , and get you , instead of focusing on your external senses , just to go internal for a second .
do you have a wal@@ let on you ? joe : i don &apos;t .
open your hand . thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to try to push it inside your hand .
down here i noticed this . is this something of yours , sir ?
never have been .
we did not imagine that there would be this many maps around the world .
could we leverage these technologies to switch smar@@ tly whenever you travel from country to country ?
and the local fin@@ an@@ cing is not part of the ecosystem for supporting hardware projects .
we need to look for something else , and we &apos;ve gotten ourselves a little bit into a ru@@ t .
this last project is also of components .
you can actually predict what kinds of books they like to read , what kinds of places they like to travel to , and what kinds of food they like to eat .
and by the matrix , i mean literally the matrix , like the movie &quot; the matrix . &quot;
it gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm .
i think this is what we come with , at least a prepar@@ ed@@ ness to learn all of these things .
notice also that on all of these graphs , the slo@@ pe is ste@@ e@@ per on in-@@ group , authority , pur@@ ity .
so this tri@@ p@@ ty@@ ch , these three panels portra@@ y the ti@@ me@@ less truth that order tends to deca@@ y .
because i think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the grand cany@@ on .
they want order , even at some cost to those at the bottom .
can you be not for or against anything ?
what i want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the western world -- australia , united states , u.k. and so on -- face in some of the dep@@ loy@@ ments that they &apos;re dealing with in the modern world at this time .
so again , they would say , &quot; well if we have access to non-@@ lethal weapons , if we &apos;ve got someone we know is hostile , we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place , at least , again , we &apos;re not going to kill them . &quot;
they generally seem to think , &quot; well , why would we care what &apos;s happened with the police ?
so the next two years were the years they studied -- 2001 , 2002 .
it was used indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ately .
in fact , he was probably six inches t@@ all@@ er than me , and she was about this tall .
they &apos;re trained to be more re@@ stra@@ ined in the use of force than the military are .
and the question he had is , &quot; can i do it ? can it be done ? &quot;
we have art students getting together , taking old radi@@ ator parts and doing an ir@@ on-@@ pour to make something new out of it .
they &apos;re a bit sub@@ ver@@ sive in what they do .
and then he didn &apos;t particularly like school that much , but he got involved in robotics competi@@ tions , and he realized he had a talent , and , more importantly , he had a real passion for it .
now that could be a dog door , it could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn &apos;t , like a little brother into a little sister &apos;s room .
this is steve wo@@ z@@ ni@@ ak . where does he learn about computers ?
and drew bar@@ ry@@ more , for all her wonderful char@@ m , is not glamorous either .
and this is he@@ dy la@@ mar@@ r .
this is fi@@ li@@ pp@@ ino li@@ pp@@ i &apos;s 15@@ 4@@ 3 portrait of sa@@ int apol@@ lon@@ ia .
so you can do a gla@@ mor@@ ized picture of a car , but you can &apos;t do a gla@@ mor@@ ized picture of traffic .
the sense of , you know , life could be better , i could join this -- i could be a perfect person , i could join this perfect world .
so , this session &apos;s supposed to be about pure pleasure but glamour &apos;s really partly about meaning .
it was critici@@ zed for gla@@ mor@@ izing violence , because , look -- sun@@ glasses and those long co@@ ats , and , of course , they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things that are impossible in the real world .
so she &apos;s even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn &apos;t stupid , even though she thought she could look stupid .
it was a way of lo@@ cating myself .
oh sure , sure , i had moments of appreciation of my body , the way an ab@@ u@@ sive parent can sometimes have a moment of kindness .
i heard about a little girl who couldn &apos;t stop pe@@ eing on herself because so many grown soldiers had sho@@ ved themselves inside her .
and the fire that burned in me on day three through six of che@@ mo is the fire that is burning in the forests of the world .
it was the honey in the water that made it sweet , it was the oil that made it sick .
it was all these things .
obviously the whole project here is huge .
and i@@ van puts his sandwich over here , on top of the pir@@ ate chest .
which sandwich is he going to take ?
no , because the wind should get in trouble .
now she thinks the pow@@ der is sugar .
okay , so it causes a small invol@@ un@@ tary contr@@ action in my hand by putting a magnetic pulse in my brain .
so , there &apos;s a couple of things to say about t@@ ms .
that &apos;s a great answer . rebe@@ c@@ ca sa@@ x@@ e , thank you very much . that was fantastic .
and sometimes it takes a wa@@ ke@@ -up call , doesn &apos;t it , to al@@ ert us to the fact that we &apos;re hur@@ rying through our lives , instead of actually living them ; that we &apos;re living the fast life , instead of the good life .
but i think if you cut through those forces , you get to what might be the deeper driver , the nu@@ b of the question , which is how we think about time itself .
and in this , towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape , so that people are encouraged to slow down and smell the ro@@ ses and connect with one another .
and nor@@ way , sweden , den@@ mark and fin@@ land now r@@ ank among the top six most competitive nations on earth , and they work the kind of hours that would make the average american we@@ ep with en@@ vy .
i think there &apos;s a kind of meta@@ physical dimension -- that speed becomes a way of w@@ all@@ ing ourselves off from the bigger , deeper questions .
i no longer hear time &apos;s win@@ ged ch@@ ari@@ ot drawing near , or at least not as much as i did before .
how do you discover the uniqu@@ eness of a project as unique as a person ?
and when there were compla@@ ints about budget , i said , &quot; well , it &apos;s worth doing the island because you get twice for your money : reflec@@ tions . &quot;
and i went down and chief minister bad@@ al said to me , &quot; we si@@ kh@@ s have suffered a great deal , as you have jews .
and again , i felt kind of uncomfortable with the notion that a building the size of the washington building -- 50,000 square feet -- will sit on that fragile hill and that we will go into gall@@ eries -- rooms with doors and sort of familiar rooms -- to tell the story of the ho@@ lo@@ cau@@ st .
studies for the structure of the roof , which demands maybe new materials : how to make it white , how to make it trans@@ luc@@ ent , how to make it glo@@ wing , how to make it not ca@@ pri@@ cious .
so i think i &apos;m going to start with what i just heard .
so i &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to play just for a second .
well we &apos;re jazz musicians , so stereoty@@ pically we don &apos;t have a great relationship to finance .
na@@ ma@@ ste . sal@@ a@@ am .
i have come from a place of intense darkness .
actually , i come from britain , but i &apos;ve been living in mal@@ di@@ ves for 26 years now .
it comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards india .
now , the particular species of dragon@@ fly i want to talk about is this one , because most dragon@@ flies , like the one we &apos;ve just seen , when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life , it doesn &apos;t go very far . it can &apos;t travel very far .
and i didn &apos;t think anything more of it until the following year , when it happened again , and then the year after that , and then the year after that .
you &apos;re too ke@@ en . you &apos;re too ke@@ en . no . hang on . hang on .
it stret@@ ches about 500 miles , of course it &apos;s india here .
that &apos;s the inter@@ -@@ mon@@ soon , the time when the mon@@ soon changes .
the lar@@ va@@ e have to develop very quickly .
and the dragon@@ flies are there . i have reports from my various cont@@ acts .
and i only stu@@ mbled on this because i was living in mal@@ é , in mal@@ di@@ ves for long enough for it to per@@ col@@ ate into my brain that something rather special was going on .
and they are not the only one that makes the crossing .
so , that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done with my life .
champ@@ ion sounds so go@@ of@@ y , but it &apos;s what it was , right ?
and this one , look how it slides side@@ ways , every which way ?
this one , a little sket@@ ch@@ y going backwards , and watch the back foot , watch the back foot .
and they &apos;re not all bad .
next . and this is something deeper , and this is where i &apos;m — i think i was on tour when i , i was reading one of the feynman bio@@ graphi@@ es . it was the red one or the blue one .
and so many people , i guess , watch those videos .
but car@@ l norden is really the one who cr@@ acks the code .
so in the years leading up to the second world war , the u.s. military bu@@ ys 9@@ 0,000 of these norden bomb@@ si@@ ghts at a cost of $ 1@@ 4,000 each -- again , in 19@@ 40 dollars , that &apos;s a lot of money .
well how many clou@@ dless sk@@ ies do you think there were above central europe between 19@@ 40 and 19@@ 45 ?
and their mission was to find and to destroy -- remember the scu@@ d missi@@ le laun@@ ch@@ ers , those sur@@ fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ air missi@@ les that the ira@@ q@@ is were laun@@ ching at the israel@@ is ?
in that exact same period that we &apos;ve been using these d@@ ron@@ es with devastating accuracy , the number of attacks , of suicide attacks and terrori@@ st attacks , against american forces in afghanistan has increased ten@@ fold .
and visit@@ ing some pretty incredible places , places like mon@@ go@@ lia , cambo@@ dia , new gu@@ ine@@ a , south africa , tanzania twice -- i was here a month ago .
but that &apos;s not really the question i &apos;m asking .
but looking around the world at the diversity of humans , he said , &quot; well , you know , we seem to come in dis@@ cre@@ et sub-@@ species or categories . &quot;
and the whole thing , if you add it all together , is over six billion nucle@@ o@@ ti@@ des long .
and what that means is that we origin@@ ated in africa . it &apos;s written in our dna .
now , africa is the most tropical continent on the planet -- about 85 percent of it lies between cancer and ca@@ pri@@ corn -- and there aren &apos;t a lot of gl@@ aci@@ ers here , except on the high mountains here in east africa .
we became much more social . the social networks expanded .
and it &apos;s based on a few thousand people we &apos;ve sam@@ pled from , you know , a hand@@ ful of populations around the world .
projects around the world -- docu@@ menting oral poetry in si@@ erra le@@ one , pre@@ serving traditional wea@@ ving patterns in gaz@@ a , language rev@@ it@@ alization in ta@@ ji@@ ki@@ stan , etc . , etc .
well , the answer seems to be , the universe can create complexity , but with great difficulty .
and at first , it &apos;s just a blu@@ r , but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blu@@ r .
stars will create the gol@@ di@@ lo@@ cks conditions for crossing two new thre@@ sh@@ olds .
you also need a great diversity of chemical elements , and you need liquid such as water .
as it copies itself , once in every billion run@@ gs , there tends to be an error .
we are ble@@ ssed with a language , a system of communication , so powerful and so precise that we can share what we &apos;ve learned with such preci@@ sion that it can accumul@@ ate in the collective memory .
collective learning is a very , very powerful force , and it &apos;s not clear that we humans are in charge of it .
and then they blame the banks for being the bad guys who gave them the mor@@ t@@ g@@ ages .
low-@@ income people spend a lot more than a thousand on lotter@@ ies .
take out those who say they save too little .
or as some economists call it , present bias .
what are the implications to saving lives and having organs available ?
it &apos;s very painful , even though it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
maybe we should make people save more when they make more money .
if you &apos;re thinking about people taking too much risk and not understanding how much risk they &apos;re taking or taking too little risk , we need to think about that .
it &apos;s completely f@@ uc@@ ked up and can only be explained in song .
you &apos;re live .
have a great session .
when i go out to direct a film , every day we prepare too much , we think too much .
and i say , &quot; cate , what do you want to do ? &quot;
so , how far does e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity go ?
we tell ourselves stories .
because she fell in love with wal@@ ter r@@ al@@ ei@@ gh , she was giving up the reasons she was a queen , and then wal@@ ter r@@ al@@ ei@@ gh fell in love with her lady in waiting , and she had to decide whether she was a queen going to war or she wanted ...
eliza@@ beth : be@@ ss ?
eliza@@ beth : this man has se@@ duc@@ ed a ward of the queen , and she has married without royal con@@ sent .
so how do i start all this ?
they suck up all the water , keep to themselves , and they dri@@ p feed the lower city .
it is fin@@ ite ; harmony is infinite .
i met a guy -- the guy on the left .
we needed to be working on be@@ ef .
this is where we stand today .
we need to use less to make more .
they may have a lot of opinions about it , but they &apos;re not going to be terribly informed .
are we going to work with 1.@@ 5 billion producers ?
we need change even working with individual companies is not probably going to get us there .
we &apos;re using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table .
it &apos;s more with less and less again .
i am a neuro@@ scientist with a mixed background in physics and medicine .
and i promise to you , this was such an important moment in my career , when i realized that the great leader believed in young people and new ideas .
let me summar@@ ize : the rat received a paraly@@ zing le@@ sion of the spinal cord .
they are the result of a young team of very talented people : physical therap@@ ists , neuro@@ biologists , neuro@@ surgeons , engineers of all kinds , who have achieved together what would have been impossible by single individuals .
a spinal cord injury can se@@ ver the communication between your brain and your body , leading to paraly@@ sis . fresh from his lab , gr@@ é@@ go@@ i@@ re cour@@ t@@ ine shows a new method -- comb@@ ining drugs , electrical stimulation and a robot -- that could re-@@ a@@ wa@@ ken the neural pathways and help the body learn again to move on its own . see how it works , as a paralyzed rat becomes able to run and navigate stairs .
i am an example of what &apos;s possible when girls from the very beginning of their lives are loved and nur@@ tured by the people around them .
and i think about that today because i am reminded and convinced that all of you in this school are very important parts of closing that gap .
i loved getting as .

instead , again , it is as if we are all sitting together in a theater , but we can only see am@@ id@@ st the fo@@ g the people immediately around us .
how did this happen ?
i am not making this up .
and wikipedia has embrac@@ ed this .
but then , you can see the same kind of wh@@ im@@ sy applied to people .
here is the chart of over 4@@ 3 people helping to ste@@ er the robot that could not ste@@ er and get it on its way , from one corner from one corner of washington square park to another .

rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last 60 years .
there could be all sorts of technologies . and one is cell phones .
so i started looking for any evidence that -- does connectivity really increase productivity ?
and one of them is the l@@ acking buying power .
and anyway , to cut the time short -- so i started -- i first went to them and said , &quot; you know , perhaps i could connect all your branches and make you more efficient . &quot;
now , about that cow model i talked about .
&quot; poor countries need aid . &quot;
in sweden we read it once and then we went part@@ ying .
18@@ 5@@ 8 in china was the vic@@ tory in the op@@ ium war by the british forces .
but really , really natural so@@ ver@@ ei@@ gn@@ ty was good for japan .
this is the great leap forward , when china fell down .
you see this enormous ine@@ qu@@ ity in china , in the mid@@ st of fast economic growth .
i will show income per person on this axis instead , poor down here , rich up there .
but the real proje@@ ctions for those ones , i would like to give it like this .
for most of my research career , i &apos;ve been using acceler@@ ators , such as the electron acceler@@ ator at stanford university , just up the road , to study things on the smallest scale .
in fact , this galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter .
now , how do we de@@ duce where the galaxy is ?
we call this gravit@@ ational len@@ sing .
and also , you can tell by eye , by looking at this , that these ar@@ cs are not cen@@ tered on individual galaxies .
the star@@ t@@ ling answer to this question , ok , from these experiments , was that space is expanding at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago , ok .
one or both , who knows ? or it could be something completely different .
we discovered blue@@ grass a few years ago , and we fell in love with it . we hope you guys will too .
and what was so sad about this particular story was that once their parents had found out -- and don &apos;t forget , their parents took them to the doctor -- the parents threw them out on the street .
they squir@@ t them at each other , which is lovely and innocent .
if you know something more , you probably know that uganda , to date , is the only country in sub-saharan africa that has had success in comb@@ ating the epidemic .
we didn &apos;t see anything like that in africa .
so one way to test to see whether we can explain some of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy is to look and see is there more behavior change in areas where there &apos;s less malaria .
it &apos;s not the only place we had any interventions .
but since there are very few other diseases that kill people , we can really attribu@@ te that mortality to hiv .
and hiv is actually particularly closely linked to trans@@ it .
their ex@@ ports went down a lot in the early 1990s -- and actually that decline lines up really , really closely with this decline in new hiv infections .
if i could reveal anything that is hidden from us , at least in modern cultures , it would be to reveal something that we &apos;ve forgotten , that we used to know as well as we knew our own names .
and he came up to me and he kno@@ cked .
so the engineer &apos;s boss said , &quot; find a way to quiet this train . &quot;

at biom@@ im@@ ic@@ ry gu@@ ild , which is my consul@@ ting company , we work with ho@@ k architects .
and hopefully , with their help , we &apos;ll learn how to live on this earth , and on this home that is ours , but not ours alone .
i go , &quot; why ? &quot;
they belon@@ ged to boys .
if they &apos;re bad , they &apos;re your creation . learn from it .
what you see , if you see the title called &quot; pm &apos;s car held . &quot;
i said , &quot; do you pray ? &quot;
i want to show you some moments of history in my journey , which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world .
and you see , everybody &apos;s busy . there was no time to waste .
text : &quot; help ! i &apos;ve been waiting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &quot;
so let me explain how this works .
and basically , since we released it about three or four years ago , a lot of websites have started swit@@ ching from the old cap@@ t@@ cha where people wa@@ sted their time to the new cap@@ t@@ cha where people are helping to digi@@ tize books .
imagine you &apos;re using the internet and you see a cap@@ t@@ cha that you think is somewhat pecu@@ liar , like this cap@@ t@@ cha .
okay , that &apos;s sever@@ in ha@@ cker .
so i &apos;ll just let you read .
so i don &apos;t even know if there exists 100 million people out there using the web who are bil@@ in@@ gu@@ al enough to help us translate .
people really can learn a language with it .
that &apos;s the current business model .
instead of investing in a car , we invest in a community .
this peers , in@@ c. concept is in a very difficult and complex realm .
so this was a trick to get these two sides .
and i can tell you two great stories .
we live longer . we have access to technology that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago .
maybe these people are right . maybe mind-@@ wandering is a bad thing .
a few minutes ago , i li@@ ken@@ ed mind-@@ wandering to a s@@ lot machine you &apos;d never want to play .
and shortly after , we left the country , and we returned to switzerland .
i mean , today , singa@@ pore is a first world country and ghana is not .
so when the ech@@ o of the gun@@ shots had lin@@ ger@@ ed , it was soon drow@@ ned by the chan@@ ting of the mo@@ b , and i didn &apos;t believe what i was hearing .
now i have learned that my place is not just in the west or in africa , and i &apos;m still searching for my identity , but i saw ghana create democracy better .
so i &apos;m going to talk a little bit about that , and what exactly is it that scientists are supposed to do .
so therefore the church said that you can &apos;t make a vacuum , you know .
the actual nature of reality was not at issue .
and , i mean , everybody in this room -- now , this is 350 short years ago .
i was thinking about making my own little rockets .
it burned kind of slow , but it made a nice smell , compared to other rocket fuels i had tried , that all had sul@@ fur in them .
but that ... process is what i think of as science , see , where you start with some idea , and then instead of , like , looking up , every authority that you &apos;ve ever heard of i -- sometimes you do that , if you &apos;re going to write a paper later , you want to figure out who else has worked on it .
they made all kinds of -- and then finally one giant bomb to end the whole thing , right ?
but nobody actually demonstrated it , right ?
you know , if they said , you know what ?
and in gra@@ d school i became interested in creatures that d@@ well in the hidden corners of the city .
when i got comfortable in the space , it also felt like a big play@@ ground .
it must have been a very unusual day for him .
they were consist@@ ently du@@ g as li@@ me@@ stone quar@@ ries and by the 18@@ th century , the ca@@ v@@ ing-@@ in of some of these quar@@ ries posed safety threats , so the government or@@ dered rein@@ for@@ cing of the existing quar@@ ries and du@@ g new observation tun@@ nels in order to monitor and map the whole place .
and this is the first theater project i worked on .
and if you can , just scri@@ bble a pattern .
and when we gave them a battery , and a piece of wire , and a bulb , and said , &quot; can you do it ? &quot; they couldn &apos;t do it . right ?
between australia and here , right , they &apos;ve got summer and we &apos;ve got winter , and what -- does the earth kind of rush towards the sun at night , and then rush back again ? i mean , it &apos;s a very strange thing going on , and we hold these two models in our head , of what &apos;s right and what isn &apos;t right , and we do that , as human beings , in all sorts of fields .
so , children are not empty vessels , ok ?
now -- oh , oh yeah , go on then , go on .
so when i thought about it , then suddenly i realized that biology gave us the answer .
so as a chemist , i wanted to say , &quot; hang on . what is going on here ?
you have regu@@ lation ; information is tran@@ scri@@ bed ; cataly@@ sts are made ; stuff is happening .
so there are two options : intelligent design , direct and indi@@ re@@ ct -- so god , or my friend .
i need some information , and i need a contain@@ er .
if we manage to do that , forget the molecular detail .
you &apos;re sitting on chairs .
because the thing is , we are so cha@@ u@@ vin@@ istic to biology , if you take away carbon , there &apos;s other things that can happen .
and i will take kenya as an example .
have got these surve@@ ys in place in their database , then they use advanced mathematical formul@@ as to produce a trend line , and the trend line looks like this .
so what i &apos;m telling you is that we know the child mortality .
here we have &#91; the &#93; year .
my ancestors moved to the united states .
here we have a problem .
and look now , the first african countries here are coming in .
that is , when we get girls in school , we &apos;ll get an impact 15 to 20 years later , which is a se@@ cular trend which is very strong .
and if they do so , then , of course , the conditions improve , and they start riding on sco@@ ot@@ ers .
of course , as soon as you say something like this people say it is impossible , and that &apos;s what was said by su@@ zu@@ ki .
broke many nor@@ ms of the standard conven@@ tions for the first time .
and nan@@ o was , bang , 2,000 dollars .
you have to design an artificial foot for such conditions .
we &apos;ve talked about mobility and the rest of it , let &apos;s talk about health .
you know something ? this has been achieved in india .
sorry , it doesn &apos;t work . you have to give it for 100 dollars , 200 dollars .
ladies and gentlemen , i &apos;d like to end before time .
when the paper burned , for some reason he turned to me , and he said , &quot; ma@@ shel@@ k@@ ar , like this , if you do not diff@@ use your ener@@ gies , if you focus your ener@@ gies , you can achieve anything in the world . &quot;
i &apos;d like to share a couple with you today .
so we &apos;re getting feedback from teachers at the school to see what kind of apps they &apos;d like .
and i realized that i had hit upon something that i think has this huge potential to change the world .
and the reason the effici@@ encies are so low is these re@@ actors operate at pretty low temperature .
the fuel , like i said , is cer@@ am@@ ic inside z@@ ir@@ con@@ ium fuel ro@@ ds , and in the event of an accident in one of these type of re@@ actors , fu@@ ku@@ shim@@ a and three mile island -- looking back at three mile island , we didn &apos;t really see this for a while — but these z@@ ir@@ con@@ ium cla@@ dd@@ ings on these fuel ro@@ ds , what happens is , when they see high pressure water , steam , in an ox@@ idi@@ zing environment , they &apos;ll actually produce hydrogen , and that hydrogen has this explo@@ sive capability to release fi@@ ssion products .
everybody was really excited about curiosity , and that had this big plu@@ ton@@ ium battery on board that has plu@@ ton@@ i@@ um@@ -@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 , which actually has a higher specific activity than the low-@@ enri@@ ched ur@@ ani@@ um fuel of these mol@@ ten salt re@@ actors , which means that the effects would be ne@@ gli@@ gible , because you launch it cold , and when it gets into space is where you actually activ@@ ate this reactor .
so , we moved from an industrial economy to a ser@@ vic@@ e-@@ based economy .
so much has that happened that i &apos;ve developed a fairly pra@@ tic@@ ed response , which is : i point out that first of all , you have to understand that there is no such thing as an in@@ authentic experience .
ren@@ dering authenticity -- and the key@@ word is &quot; ren@@ dering . &quot;
fact is , there &apos;s a general rule : if you don &apos;t like it , it &apos;s fake ; if you do like it , it &apos;s fa@@ u@@ x .
the ab@@ c network , affe@@ c@@ tion@@ ately known in the trade as the t &amp; amp ; a network , right -- that &apos;s not too much jar@@ gon , is it ?
let me summar@@ ize it , for the business people in the audience , with three rules , three basic rules .
i was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery and becoming a surgeon , because it meant working with my hands in a very focused , intense way .
that &apos;s about that big .
so , it &apos;s sort of related , but you can see it &apos;s much more over@@ tly ero@@ tic .
but i had a lot of fun .
and your entire body , everything -- your hair , skin , bone , na@@ ils -- everything is made of col@@ la@@ gen .
the mar@@ vel of this information : how do we actually have this biological mechanism inside our body to actually see this information ?
ima@@ ge-@@ maker alexander t@@ si@@ ar@@ as shares a powerful medical visualization , showing human development from con@@ ception to birth and beyond .
because they thought that if you are having a telescope , you are an astronom@@ er so what you are doing is actually looking in a telescope .
and we have a cool atmosphere .
this was considered as first evidence that actually black holes come from super@@ no@@ va@@ e explo@@ sions .
and this is related to the change of the frequency of a moving source .
it &apos;s very tough . it &apos;s very tough .
there can be different ways doing this .
and i thought , &quot; well , what &apos;s the struggle ? &quot;
and i &apos;m more of the , &quot; life &apos;s messy , clean it up , organize it and put it into a ben@@ to box . &quot;
the things i can tell you about it : it &apos;s universal ; we all have it .
so what i did is i took all of the interviews where i saw wor@@ thin@@ ess , where i saw people living that way , and just looked at those .
they thought this was fundamental .
and she said , &quot; what &apos;s the struggle ? &quot;
no .
and then we are miserable , and we are looking for purpose and meaning , and then we feel vulnerable , so then we have a couple of be@@ ers and a ban@@ ana nu@@ t mu@@ ff@@ in .
and when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand , our job is not to say , &quot; look at her , she &apos;s perfect .

so , the first set of patho@@ logi@@ es , they end up in the stick man on his icon , but the rest of them are really what &apos;s important here .
those are things that are different for each m@@ .@@ s. patient .
all open , all available .
years after he &apos;s had these drugs , i learned that everything he did to manage his ex@@ cess s@@ ali@@ va , including some positive side effects that came from other drugs , were making his con@@ sti@@ pation worse .
so , this is what happened when p@@ n@@ as published this .
and then we say , &quot; well how do we line them all up ? &quot;
even the ones that believed they were getting better matched the controls exactly . exactly .
you look at the patients , you can drill in all the controls , you can look at them , you can ask them .
only 90 days after this , argu@@ ably the greatest discovery of the last century occurred .
to change its state , by the way , takes two vol@@ ts from a milli@@ second pulse .
we said , &quot; could you build this ? &quot;
it &apos;s just wrong .
unfortunately , the answer is yes .
so if it &apos;s a cell or a ter@@ m@@ ite or a bird , you just focus on the rules of interaction .
i think this is an interesting question .
so this means that , with each e@@ ur@@ o he invested , he was able to move 26 euro@@ s of market value through the chain of ownership relations .
we hope to have opened the door for more such research in this direction , so the remaining unknown terrain will be char@@ ted in the future .
if we look at construction and manufacturing , there &apos;s major ine@@ ffici@@ encies , energy consumption and exc@@ es@@ sive labor techniques .
so we can study this as a physical , intuitive model .
these are parts being printed with multi-@@ material properties .
these are complex things built with complex parts that come together in complex ways .
now that was cheating , because there was nothing in the world my sister would want more than not to be amy the hurt five year-old little sister , but amy the special un@@ ic@@ or@@ n .
now if you fall below the average on this curve , then psychologists get thrilled , because that means you &apos;re either depressed or you have a disorder , or hopefully both .
suddenly , something that wasn &apos;t even a possibility became a reality .
th@@ ur@@ s@@ day night is e@@ licit drug use .
you &apos;re 37 percent better at sales .
this was how computing began .
and because working in a store was so hard , i liked going to school ; it was like heaven .
i didn &apos;t quite get it . and paul r@@ and was a kind of cru@@ sty designer , you know , a cru@@ sty designer , like a good -- kind of like a good french bread ?
it la@@ sts forever . it &apos;s a very strange medium .
on the computer , when you move your mouse , that ar@@ row moves around .
he went into a com@@ a .
i began to be very dis@@ interested in computers themselves , so i began to make paintings out of pal@@ mp@@ i@@ lots .
this i found , where nature had made a picture for me .
and so i realized it was o@@ .@@ k. to go .
but , in fact , most boys tend to be a certain way , and most girls tend to be a certain way .
video games are not the cause .
i want to write about a tor@@ na@@ do that comes into our house and blo@@ ws all the windows out and ru@@ ins all the furniture and kills everybody . &quot;
we have a serious com@@ pression of the curriculum happening out there .
most of the educational games that are out there today are really fla@@ sh@@ cards .
they &apos;re nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero tolerance policies .
we will find a surprising and intriguing result about our universe , and to explain my point , let me first tell you what the higgs is about , and to do so , we have to go back to one ten@@ th of a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the big bang .
is this a problem ? yes , it &apos;s a big a problem .
more than how a phenomenon works , theoretical physicists are always interested in why a phenomenon works in the way it works .
i love paper , and i love technology , and what i do is i make paper interactive .
so the challenge was to try and get them to do what we wanted them to do by listening to the weather , the lay of the land , and creating things that would let the sheep flow and go where we wanted them to go .
it &apos;s just a collection of things that have been done before , but bringing them together in a different way .
so a couple of things i &apos;ve created are , there &apos;s a poster over here that you can play dru@@ ms on .
so thank you very much .
you can walk away , you can just watch as this character stands there in the bl@@ en@@ der and looks at you , or you can actually choose to interact with it .
but we haven &apos;t yet gotten to the point where on your way here this morning you see something that really , truly se@@ am@@ lessly integr@@ ates the two-@@ dimensional world that we &apos;re comfortable in with the three-dimensional sky above us -- that , i don &apos;t know about you , but i really enjoy spending time in .
fortunately , necess@@ ity remains the mother of invention , and a lot of the design work that we &apos;re the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground -- everything from a continu@@ ous@@ ly-@@ variable transmission and li@@ qui@@ d-@@ based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop@@ -and-@@ go traffic , to a custom@@ -@@ designed ge@@ ar@@ box that powers either the prope@@ ller when you &apos;re flying or the wheels on the ground , to the autom@@ ated win@@ g-@@ folding mechanism that we &apos;ll see in a moment , to crash safety features .
and our test pilot gave us the best feedback you can get from a test pilot after a first flight , which was that it was &quot; remarkably un@@ remarkable . &quot;
just fold up the wings and keep going .
now , here is another nai@@ ve advertising man &apos;s question again .
so he tried plan b .
tiny little behavioral economics detail : in italy , pen@@ alty points go backwards .
there is a basic view that real value involves making things , involves labor . it involves engineering .
it ta@@ stes great within the borders of that country , but absolute sh@@ ite if you take it anywhere else .
vo@@ ice@@ over : new diam@@ ond shred@@ dies cere@@ al .
we need to spend more time appreci@@ ating what already exists , and less time ag@@ on@@ izing over what else we can do .
it took me hours and hours a day to build my skills up to the next level .
we &apos;re the ones who let the second repli@@ ca@@ tor out of its box , and we can &apos;t push it back in .
you see the idea ?
he talked mostly about animals and plants , but also about languages evolving and becoming extinct .
a meme is not equivalent to an idea .
s@@ b : par@@ don ?
from the moment that our ancestors , perhaps two and a half million years ago or so , began im@@ itating , there was a new copying process .
and we &apos;re getting there .
the fraction of those which get a first repli@@ ca@@ tor .
do you know , sitting here , your brain is using about 20 percent of your body &apos;s energy output for two percent of your body weight ?
and why would they do that ?
it was 25 minutes of absolute terror that thousands of people across the u.s. felt .
there is nothing here that we don &apos;t know .
through haiti re@@ wired , through build change , architecture for humanity , a@@ id@@ g , there is the possibility to reach out to 30,000 -- 40,000 mas@@ ons across the country and create a movement of proper building .
this is not just in he@@ bre@@ w , by the way .
and i want to give you one example of one of these ir@@ ra@@ tion@@ alities , and i want to talk to you about cheating .
we paid them 10 cents per correct question , 50 cents , a dollar , five dollars , 10 dollars per correct question .
now , ten command@@ ments is something that is hard to bring into the education system , so we said , &quot; why don &apos;t we get people to sign the honor code ? &quot;
but this did not solve the big problem i had with en@@ ron yet , because in en@@ ron , there &apos;s also a social element .
all of the subjects sitting in the experiment were car@@ ne@@ gie mel@@ l@@ on students .
more generally , i want to tell you something about behavioral economics .
but if i was to say that they &apos;re both examples of alternative or new forms of currency in a hyper@@ connected , dat@@ a-@@ driven global economy , you &apos;d probably think i was a little bit bon@@ kers .
&quot; sub-@@ prime pe@@ d@@ aling . &quot; &quot; bar@@ cla@@ ys takes you for a ride . &quot;
so you can buy apps and make purcha@@ ses within those apps , but you think about amazon , you look at the trust bar@@ ome@@ ter that i showed you where people are starting to trust businesses , especially businesses that they believe in and trust more than governments .
and we did a survey that backs up the fact that , you know , 45 percent of people in this very crucial demographic in the u.s .
and what i do is i look for simil@@ arities and differences in the solutions that they &apos;ve evolved for fundamental biological problems .
it &apos;s easy to bend .
because after about six months of me talking about this , i think he finally figured out that i was really serious about the pen@@ is thing .
so something interesting had to be going on .
not just about its genetics and molecular biology , but up here in the meat end of the scale .
and she said , just talk about yourself .
d@@ l : so anyway , we &apos;re running out of time , so i &apos;ll just get to it .
n@@ m : not too fast .
so this is our last number , and we &apos;ll feature n@@ at on piano .
as you can see from the pictures , both no@@ am and i had an early fas@@ c@@ ination with first principles , and over the years , as our knowledge of science and technology became more sophisticated , this early a@@ we with the ba@@ sics has only inten@@ si@@ fied .
the people who are attracted to these courses typically have a ha@@ cker men@@ tality .
so with that , i &apos;d like to say a few words about up@@ gra@@ ding , and share with you a glimpse from my current project , which is different from the previous one , but it shares exactly the same characteristics of self-@@ learning , learning by doing , self-@@ exploration and commun@@ ity-@@ building , and this project deals with k-@@ 12 math education , beginning with early age math , and we do it on tab@@ lets because we believe that math , like anything else , should be taught hands on .
it basically means to be human and to do the right thing .
it would be great if the story ended there .
where does it come from ?
this is about a hidden corner of the labor market .
of course , they &apos;re all trained to work in war@@ e@@ houses .
markets have changed beyond recognition in the last 20 years , but only for organizations at the top of the economy .
politicians in a big , complex , sophisticated i.@@ t. project ?
and there are certain obli@@ ga@@ tions that should go with those benefits to be placed on the oper@@ ators , and the key one is , of course , that the oper@@ ators pay for everything , including all the inter@@ facing into the public sector .
so it &apos;s small tra@@ des by small people , but it &apos;s very informed , safe , convenient , low-@@ overhead and immediate .
with every picture , there are individuals who have full lives and stories that deserve to be told .
gas , i &apos;m probably the only person who really enjo@@ ys it when mi@@ ster pu@@ tin turns off the gas tap , because my budget goes up .
but small atoms want to join together , small nucle@@ i want to join together to make bigger ones to go towards iron .
but fortunately , if you can do this fusion reaction , you &apos;ve got a neutr@@ on , so you can make that happen .
and just down the road , this is jet .
i wish we had more money , i wish we had more resources .
but under the surface was a very different reality .
the signs don &apos;t look good , some have said .
the egyp@@ tian people , and many other arab@@ s who &apos;ve rev@@ ol@@ ted and are in transition , have very high expectations of the government .
what this means is that human development , not se@@ cul@@ ar@@ ization , is what &apos;s key to women &apos;s empower@@ ment in the transforming middle east .
we &apos;ve also found an un@@ intended consequence .
because i &apos;m not really comfortable just helping that girl with coun@@ sel@@ ing and refer@@ r@@ als .
when nan@@ cy lu@@ bl@@ in started texting teenagers to help with her social ad@@ voca@@ cy organization , what she found was shocking -- they started texting back about their own problems , from bul@@ lying to depression to abuse . so she &apos;s setting up a tex@@ t-@@ only crisis line , and the results might be even more important than she expected .
fer@@ din@@ and fo@@ ch , a french army general cred@@ ited with having one of the most original and subtle minds in the french army , said , &quot; airplanes are interesting toys , but of no military value . &quot;
and it &apos;s pointed at the hy@@ person@@ ic gli@@ der .
many prototypes cra@@ shed -- many .
from the smallest wis@@ p of air to the powerful forces of nature &apos;s storms .
it allows us to contribute and to be heard as individuals .
doubt and fear always cre@@ ep in .
yeah , it also went into the pacific .
the folks at aero@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment tried 300 or more different wing designs , 12 different forms of the avi@@ onics .
i work with some of the most amazing people .
and there is no way , and no proof of arri@@ val .
this story began four years ago .
i &apos;m used to algorithms and data structures and super motivated students , and nothing in my background prepared me to deal with a ra@@ ging , violent adolesc@@ ent in the middle of nowhere .
when he was eight , someone put him on a boat in o@@ de@@ ss@@ a and sent him , shi@@ pped him to israel on his own .
i tell kids when they struggle through some u@@ ph@@ ill and feel like they cannot take it anymore , it really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles and raise your head and look around and see how the vi@@ sta around you grows .
now i remember , when he said it , i felt goo@@ se@@ bu@@ mps on my body , because he said it over@@ looking the mo@@ a@@ b mountains here in the background .
what is real is separ@@ at@@ eness , and at some point in early bab@@ y@@ hood , the idea of self starts to form .
it has an extremely important function .
well , i thought i had the answer to that one , and i said , &quot; skin color . &quot;
the self &apos;s struggle for authenticity and definition will never end unless it &apos;s connected to its creator -- to you and to me .
and if you can do that , incredible things happen .
and this influenced me .
so it &apos;s got hybri@@ d drive .
and so we spent time traveling with them and learning about all the different elements , and finding that there were plenty of ine@@ ffici@@ encies that weren &apos;t being capit@@ alized on .
so there are up to a million people there everyday .
by the way , we had half the budget of the other western nations .
the british government -- any government is potentially the worst client in the world you could ever possibly want to have .
thank you .
one of them , from anthropo@@ logy , is the study of human univer@@ s@@ als .
but if something is written on the s@@ late , then some people could have more of it than others , and according to this line of thinking , that would justi@@ fy di@@ scri@@ mination and inequality .
well , pretty soon they were bar@@ ra@@ ged with en@@ ra@@ ged letters , death threats , ban on the topic in a number of scientific journ@@ als , coming from ir@@ ate left-@@ hand@@ ers and their ad@@ voca@@ tes , and they were literally afraid to open their mail because of the ven@@ om and v@@ itu@@ per@@ ation that they had in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently inspired .
by any economic standard , the demand for art of all forms is sky@@ rocke@@ ting , as you can tell from the price of opera tic@@ kets , by the number of books sold , by the number of books published , the number of musical ti@@ tles released , the number of new albu@@ ms and so on .
well , the argument in &quot; the blank s@@ late &quot; was that elite art and critici@@ sm in the 20th century , although not the arts in general , have dis@@ da@@ ined beauty , pleasure , clar@@ ity , insight and style .
wrong . identical tw@@ ins , or any si@@ blin@@ gs , who are separated at birth are no less similar than if they had grown up together .
so i called the human@@ e society and i say , &quot; look , i &apos;m going to be ca@@ str@@ ating some la@@ mbs , can you tell me the deal ? &quot;
and i &apos;m like that &apos;s not rubber at all , you know .
and i said , &quot; yes , like the human@@ e society .
al@@ bert instruc@@ ts , &quot; push it way up there . &quot;
it &apos;s what our network does ; it &apos;s what &quot; dirty jobs &quot; is .
i can still see hil@@ lary doing the shots of ry@@ e , dri@@ bb@@ ling down her ch@@ in , with the steel workers .
you ask him , &quot; did you follow your passion here ? &quot;
un@@ spea@@ kably dangerous .
you see him all the time .
i got a lot wrong .
i &apos;ve got par@@ ent-@@ child rela@@ tional problems , which i blame my parents for .
but he fa@@ ked it too well , and now he &apos;s stuck in broad@@ mo@@ or and nobody will believe he &apos;s sane .
fake ma@@ dness .
it &apos;s just impossible . &quot;
and his clin@@ ician said to me , &quot; if you want to know more about psych@@ opa@@ ths , you can go on a psychop@@ ath spo@@ tting course run by robert h@@ are who invented the psychop@@ ath check@@ list . &quot;
can i come and interview you about your special brain an@@ om@@ aly ? &quot;
and he looked intrigu@@ ed despite himself , and he said , &quot; okay , go on . &quot;
and we sti@@ tch them together like medi@@ eval mon@@ ks .
anyway , that was two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended .
let me say par@@ en@@ the@@ tically why i think that &apos;s the case , because i think it &apos;s a potentially controversial statement .
you can show a mosqu@@ e , or you can show wor@@ shi@@ p@@ pers , but there &apos;s not a straightforward way of depic@@ ting islam .
and the hopeful response deri@@ ves from recognizing that islam and democracy are technologies .
because they would have done extraordinarily well .
and it is crucial -- it is crucial in a practical , activist way -- for people who care about these issues to make sure that within the technology of democracy , in this system , they exercise their prefer@@ ences , their choices and their voices to encourage that outcome .
now at the time , i was working down the street .
and collectively , we really didn &apos;t know if we could pull this off .
but an interesting thing was no@@ ted during the training process .
and they could be extinct in less than 10 years , if we don &apos;t do something now to protect them .
corner row rail@@ way , station car park , front of a health center , people &apos;s front gardens , and even in front of the police station .
so , back to the public meeting .
so we got some land that was don@@ ated by a local garden center .
whi@@ che@@ ver way they want to do it , of their own vo@@ li@@ tion , they &apos;re trying to make their own lives differently , and worldwide , we &apos;ve got communities across america and japan -- it &apos;s incredible , isn &apos;t it ? i mean , america and japan and new zealand .
and i &apos;m also rather surprised , because when i look back on my life the last thing i ever wanted to do was write , or be in any way involved in religion .
so if religion is not about believing things , what is it about ?
and this struggle to find compassion in some of these rather re@@ bar@@ ba@@ tive texts is a good dress re@@ hear@@ sal for doing the same in ordinary life .
tell us where we &apos;re going wrong . let &apos;s talk together about where religion is failing . &quot;
it &apos;s what is meant by over@@ coming the horror that we feel when we are under threat of our enemies , and beginning to appreciate the other .
as we go smaller , here is a human hair .
so this little ant that &apos;s cra@@ wling here , it &apos;s like it &apos;s in a little wil@@ ly won@@ ka land .
i couldn &apos;t believe it , and i &apos;d go around disse@@ cting the little bits out and making photographs of them .
now , the moon has no atmosphere , so micro@@ me@@ te@@ or@@ ites come in continuously , and the whole surface of the moon is covered with pow@@ der now , because for four billion years it &apos;s been bom@@ bar@@ ded by micro@@ me@@ te@@ or@@ ites , and when micro@@ me@@ te@@ or@@ ites come in at about 20 to 60,000 miles an hour , they va@@ po@@ ri@@ ze on contact .
it was just one of those po@@ t-@@ luck things where you get it right first time .
the design comes from within .
technology in x-ray where it &apos;s life-@@ size process@@ ed , apart from these large car@@ go@@ -@@ scanning machines , hasn &apos;t moved on enough for the quality of the image and the resolution to be good enough for what i want to do with it , which is show my pictures big .
and when they do , i &apos;m in the que@@ ue .
and that &apos;s how this was done . it &apos;s actually slice , slice .
but i could get a bit dar@@ ker in the tube , but everything else would suffer .
and i think that would look quite neat as an x-ray .
but i also don &apos;t understand how it does ru@@ in the magic .
but every single thing that makes us , every atom in us , has already created a my@@ ri@@ ad of different things and will go on to create a my@@ ri@@ ad of new things .
now i know you don &apos;t think that .
every time i breathe in , i &apos;m breathing in a milli@@ on-@@ billi@@ on-@@ billion atoms of oxygen .
meet tony . he &apos;s my student .
maybe it &apos;s you , maybe it &apos;s me -- but we &apos;re not here to trade opinions ; everyone &apos;s got an opinion .
and i say to tony , &quot; let &apos;s do this . &quot;
everything was okay , until i got to about the age of 26 , and i went to a movie called &quot; short circuit . &quot;
and this is happening here .
so you start really understanding that you can have diseases , tox@@ ins , a need to balance your diet , and once you start looking , and from that point on , everything i have done in terms of the consumption of information , the production of information , the preparation of information , i &apos;ve looked at from the vie@@ w@@ point of food .
we &apos;ve spent a great deal of time investi@@ gating a $ 1 billion -- that &apos;s right , a $ 1 billion — oil deal that he was involved with , and what we found was pretty shocking , but more about that later .
a bank in paris held accounts of companies controlled by him , one of which was used to buy the art , and american banks , well , they fun@@ ne@@ led 7@@ 3 million dollars into the states , some of which was used to buy that california man@@ sion .
it found that over 70 percent of those cases had used anonymous shell companies , tot@@ aling almost 5@@ 6 billion dollars .
now , it just shouldn &apos;t take these sorts of efforts to find out where the money in deals like this went .
i see this word , hear this word , feel this word everywhere .
you become your nation . you become your religion .
i loved when he was talking about this other world that &apos;s right next to this world .
she &apos;s a high school student .
not running from loss , but entering gri@@ ef , sur@@ ren@@ dering to sor@@ row .
because when you spend a lot of time going from place to place , country to country , and city to city , the degree to which women , for example , are viol@@ ated , and the epidemic of it , and the kind of ordin@@ ar@@ iness of it , is so devastating to one &apos;s soul that you have to take the time , or i have to take the time now , to process that .
now i was stupid , but not so stupid that i turned it down .
pure content and pure form , side by side .
i was so wa@@ sted . &quot;
i set up the type , i printed it out on an ep@@ son printer with wat@@ er-@@ solu@@ ble ink , ta@@ ped it to the wall and threw a bu@@ cket of water at it . pres@@ to !
seriously .
not exactly jac@@ kie col@@ lin@@ s .
like my wish that no one went hungry or that everything were a free kind of u@@ top@@ ia .
we love challenges , but when expectations are low , trust me , we will sink to them .
and in case you don &apos;t think that this really has meaning for you , remember that clon@@ ing is possible , and that involves going through childhood again , in which case you &apos;ll want to be heard just like my generation .
when i began recording in the late &apos; 60s , the typical methods of recording were limited to the fra@@ gmented capture of individual species like birds mostly , in the beginning , but later animals like mammals and am@@ phi@@ bi@@ ans .
however , our ears tell us a very different story .
this is probably the sa@@ d@@ dest sound i &apos;ve ever heard coming from any organism , human or other .
the school teachers weren &apos;t having much fun , the sports were very dirty or very painful .
but of course the scientists couldn &apos;t help themselves .
so there &apos;s a lot more female gam@@ ers than people are really aware .
so as far as popu@@ lar@@ ity of games , what do you think these people are doing here ?
and once we get enough of those guys , we &apos;re going to want more fantasy artists that can create places we &apos;ve never been to before , or characters that we &apos;ve just never seen before .
i &apos;m addi@@ cted , because even though i know i &apos;m losing my gri@@ p on reality , i still cra@@ ve more .
no bu@@ tt@@ ons to push , no trig@@ gers to pull , just me and the game .
but maybe brain@@ washing isn &apos;t always bad .
as far as colle@@ ges go , there &apos;s about 350 colle@@ ges around the world teaching video game courses .
thank you .
somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our fla@@ ws .
so a kid who &apos;s 14 in high school gets this version of the py@@ th@@ a@@ go@@ re@@ an theore@@ m , which is a truly subtle and interesting proof , but in fact it &apos;s not a good way to start learning about mathematics .
and the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two progre@@ ssions as a first-@@ order dis@@ crete differ@@ ential equation and a secon@@ d-@@ order dis@@ crete differ@@ ential equation , deri@@ ved by six-@@ year-olds .
so if you look at the little script here , the speed is always going to be 30 .
and they say , &quot; oh , yeah . constant acceler@@ ation .
the future of life , where the un@@ ra@@ v@@ eling of our biology -- and bring up the lights a little bit . i don &apos;t have any slides .
now i know there &apos;s been a whole lot of hy@@ pe about our power to control biology .
it will really make us question what it is to be a human being .
and it is really not su@@ ited for the future that we &apos;re moving into .
there are three obvious ways of doing this .
humanity is going to go down this path .
the one thing though that is really dangerous about these sorts of technologies , is that it &apos;s easy to become se@@ duc@@ ed by them .
and then what comes out of it ? new life .
gre@@ gory stock : to up@@ grade is human
it &apos;s our own pon@@ d . and that &apos;s how it happens . &quot;
mom , does the man just say , &apos; is now the time to take off my pants ? &apos; &quot; and i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
and then she goes , &quot; mom , do you think they would have , on the internet , any humans mating ? &quot;
so the possibility exists to simply ex@@ ter@@ n@@ ally wrap the pipe .
once you &apos;ve made it , the installation &apos;s quite easy .
and as you can see , there are not only two princi@@ pal technical discipl@@ ines there , medicine and engineering , but also there are various speci@@ alists from within those two discipl@@ ines .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s the same in po@@ land .
they simply want to do whatever they &apos;ve done before .
and as a result , it &apos;s an entirely different use of the technology and the knowledge around you .
that makes a good cartoon .
it has ro@@ cked the music industry ; it has changed the way we consume music .
you know the story .
and i went to see the doz@@ o .
and i didn &apos;t ask them to do nice cartoons .
thank you .
if you go back two billion years , you &apos;re not on an ear@@ th-@@ like planet any more .
we are right now in the beautiful ore@@ o of existence -- of at least life on planet earth -- following the first horrible microbial age .
and the black rock is the se@@ di@@ ment on the sea bottom in the absence of plan@@ k@@ ton .
these are mam@@ mal@@ -like re@@ p@@ tiles .
the survi@@ vors that do get through produce this world of cro@@ codi@@ le-@@ like creatures .
it can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen , and is totally satur@@ ated with hydrogen sul@@ fi@@ de -- enough , for instance , to come out of solution .
it &apos;s been on this planet since the animals first started -- 500 million years .
now , the same mouse is given 80 parts per million hydrogen sul@@ fi@@ de in this solid graph , and look what happens to its temperature .
am i understanding you right , that what you &apos;re saying here is that we have in our own bodies a bio@@ chemical response to hydrogen sul@@ fi@@ de that in your mind pro@@ ves that there have been past mass extin@@ ctions due to climate change ?
it &apos;s forced child labor and all of those products probably end their lives in a du@@ mp like this one in man@@ ila .
and their factory in china -- which probably is pretty clean -- is getting all of the ingredients from backyard ab@@ at@@ to@@ irs , where families s@@ laughter pigs and extract the ingredient .
their vot@@ ers are local .
even if they did their jobs , and they c@@ ited those facilities for their vio@@ lations , the fine would be der@@ is@@ ory .
you can call yourself responsible , but responsibility without accountability often doesn &apos;t work .
there are thousands of supp@@ li@@ ers in there . &quot;
join us , come into that safe space , and let &apos;s start to make this happen .
you will put the star in starting over , and over .
so i write poems to figure things out .
now i can divide my spoken word journey into three steps .
and then someone else has something the complete opposite of yours .
it &apos;s not that i think that spoken word poetry is the ideal art form .
and i always thought that my beginning was at the bo@@ wer@@ y poetry club , but it &apos;s possible that it was much earlier .
it &apos;s what i stri@@ ve for every time i open my mouth -- that impossible connection .
i was a student in the &apos; 60s , a time of social u@@ ph@@ ea@@ val and ques@@ tioning , and on a personal level , an a@@ wa@@ k@@ ening sense of ide@@ alism .
but i was driven by an inher@@ ent sense that a picture that revealed the true face of war would almost by definition be an anti-@@ war photograph .
one of the things i had to learn as a journalist was what to do with my anger .
this man had just been liber@@ ated from a hu@@ tu death camp .
i spent a good deal of time with a man who lived with his family on a rail@@ way emb@@ an@@ k@@ ment and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident .
an m@@ s@@ f hospital in a camp for dis@@ placed people .
this is a helicopter medi@@ c giving c@@ p@@ r to a soldier who had been shot in the head .
whenever there is an election , it seems like something always goes wrong , someone tries to cheat , or something goes acci@@ dentally a@@ wr@@ y -- a bal@@ lot box goes missing here , cha@@ ds are left hanging over here .
and there &apos;s some complicated cry@@ p@@ to@@ graphy going on in there , but what &apos;s not complicated is voting with one of these forms .
david bi@@ smar@@ k demo@@ s a new system for voting that contains a simple , veri@@ fi@@ able way to prevent fra@@ ud and mi@@ sc@@ oun@@ ting -- while keeping each person &apos;s vote secret .
but that sub@@ divi@@ des christi@@ an@@ ity , islam and buddhi@@ sm into many sub@@ groups , which was too detailed .
but there was also many christian countries that had six to seven babies per woman .
but there are also countries here like gu@@ ate@@ mal@@ a , like pa@@ pu@@ a new gu@@ ine@@ a , like yemen and afghanistan .
here we have q@@ atar today , and there we have bangladesh today .
and the world population will stop growing .
and then again the old will die and you will get two billion children .
i w@@ ound up on every television show .
we declar@@ ed smallpox eradi@@ cated in 19@@ 80 .
but in that year , smallpox explo@@ ded throughout india .
we failed three other times .
this year , that one hospital will give back sight to more than 3@@ 00,000 people in ta@@ mi@@ l n@@ ad@@ u , india .
within three weeks it will be everywhere in the world .
but in all seri@@ ousness -- because this idea is bir@@ thed in ted , i would like it to be a legacy of ted , and i &apos;d like to call it the &quot; international system for total early disease detection . &quot;
but they were able to point to who and let them know that there was this surprising and unex@@ pla@@ ined cluster of ill@@ ne@@ sses that looked like bird flu .
the first number is three : three billion people .
we know from asking people from china to the u.s .
you &apos;ll change your smart@@ phone seven or eight times , probably more if you &apos;re in this audience .
actually , we found 100 percent is easier to do than 90 percent or 50 percent .
the electricity is free .
and we do not want to wait another hundred years .
there was this equation in my family that went something like this : if you are intelligent , you therefore are not spiritual .
i &apos;ve always been attracted to those rare people who pull that off , who de@@ vote their lives to humanity with the gr@@ it of the warri@@ or and the grace of the my@@ stic -- people like martin lu@@ ther king , j@@ r . , who wrote , &quot; i can never be what i ought to be until you are what you ought to be .
or maybe your bro@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law who doesn &apos;t believe in global warming .
we agreed we &apos;d speak up in our own communities when we witnessed the kind of &quot; other@@ izing &quot; talk that can w@@ ound and fe@@ ster into par@@ ano@@ ia and then be used by those on the fr@@ in@@ ges to in@@ c@@ ite .
i traveled to iraq , afghanistan and lib@@ eria .
and he &apos;s on a mission .
and that they were definitely capable of diff@@ using it non-@@ aggre@@ ssively .
but the question that lin@@ ger@@ ed in my mind was , what causes people to destroy fire trucks headed to their own homes ?
it &apos;s been reported that wiki@@ lea@@ ks , your baby , has , in the last few years has released more classi@@ fied documents than the rest of the world &apos;s media combined .
and then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on mo@@ i , who was the ri@@ chest man -- still is the ri@@ chest man -- in kenya .
ro@@ ger . i got &apos; em .
j well , because these sort of things reveal what the true state of , say , arab governments are like , the true human-@@ rights ab@@ uses in those governments .
it will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope .
and the engineering report had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extremely difficult document for us .
can that be right ?
that made you very high-@@ profile in iceland . what happened next ?
the musicians played off a three-dimensional graph of weather data like this .
the vertical elements are as@@ signed a specific hour of the day .
lau@@ ren ho@@ dge : if you were going to a restaurant and wanted a healthier option , which would you choose , gri@@ lled or fri@@ ed chicken ?
so it was a big commitment to drive to the lab to work multiple times .
sounds ridiculous , right .
in fact , it &apos;s one of the biggest problems with chemotherapy today .
1.@@ 6 million deaths worldwide .
so ju@@ lie &apos;s going to her doctor &apos;s office to get treated for her asth@@ ma .
so i want you to re@@ imagine a world with better air quality , better quality of life and better quality of living for everyone including our future generations .
and just like that , i went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as &quot; disabled &quot; to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn &apos;t have yet .
and interestingly , from an identity stand@@ point , what does it mean to have a disability ?
so wh@@ im@@ sy matters .
thank you .
so after being inter@@ ro@@ gated by this japanese man@@ ager for a half an hour , he finally said , &quot; so , miss yan@@ g , do you have any questions to ask me ? &quot;
so today i want to talk about young people through the platform of social media .
first of all , most of them were born in the 80s and 90s , under the one-@@ child policy .
so for the past few years , the coast@@ al areas , they found themselves in a shor@@ tage of labor .
while young people seem to be very sure about their participation in public poli@@ cy@@ -making , but sometimes they &apos;re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life .
and our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves .
these mountains are dangerous places , but ultimately the fate of these bear families , and indeed that of all bears around the north pacific , depends on the sal@@ mon .
necess@@ ity is the mother of evolution .
but just looking up with the naked eye , you really don &apos;t need one .
a culture which is top-@@ down , owned , where the vo@@ cal chor@@ ds of the millions have been lost .
now , as@@ cap said they didn &apos;t care .
i want to share all my love with you ...
the extre@@ mism on one side be@@ gets extre@@ mism on the other , a fact we should have learned many , many times over , and both extre@@ mes in this debate are just wrong .
we can only make them , quote , &quot; pir@@ ates . &quot; and is that good ?
because we &apos;re far from home , we &apos;re very tired . &quot;
so i know it may sound like tough love , but look , if at some point you got lied to , it &apos;s because you agreed to get lied to .
if you don &apos;t want to be de@@ cei@@ ved , you have to know , what is it that you &apos;re hungry for ?
lying has evolutionary value to us as a species .
the rest of us , we &apos;re only 5@@ 4 percent accurate .
we all cha@@ tter with our finger@@ tips .
they &apos;re going to be in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ated if they sense they &apos;re wr@@ on@@ gly ac@@ c@@ used throughout the entire course of the interview , not just in fla@@ shes ; they &apos;ll be in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ated throughout the entire course of the interview .
your new joint venture partner might shake your hand , celebrate , go out to dinner with you and then lea@@ k an expression of anger .
don &apos;t be too aggressive , it doesn &apos;t work .
but you &apos;ve got to ask yourself in the mean@@ time : who do you want on your side of the meeting , someone who &apos;s trained in getting to the truth or some guy who &apos;s going to drag a 40@@ 0-@@ pound electro@@ en@@ ce@@ ph@@ alo@@ gram through the door ?
it &apos;s down@@ hill from now on . i wanted to thank e@@ me@@ ka and chris .
that &apos;s very important .
nigeria got its independence in 1960 .
so i had a very inven@@ tive teacher , a paki@@ stan@@ i muslim , who wanted to teach us about this .
and fra@@ ser &apos;s on his kne@@ es , arms tied behind his back , and he &apos;s crying .
and i watched them being locked up in prison and tear gas@@ sed .
my friend ron@@ ald got@@ tes@@ man says there are three kinds of people in the world : those who can count , and those who can &apos;t .
one of my favorite parts of my job at the gates foundation is that i get to travel to the developing world , and i do that quite reg@@ ularly .
they tap into local entreprene@@ uri@@ al talent , and they do incredible marketing .
and they decided in 1990 that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs , giving them small lo@@ ans .
now the reason these micro-@@ entrepreneurs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pu@@ sh@@ cart or their wheel@@ bar@@ row .
and i think that &apos;s a mistake .
we know that circum@@ ci@@ sion reduc@@ es hiv infection by 60 percent in men .
well on september 4@@ th , there was a huge m@@ op@@ -up campaign , which is what you do in polio .
i &apos;m going to tell you two things today : one is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back .
this is where you can see most of the florida keys national marine san@@ c@@ tu@@ ary .
but still , now we have global warming .
and this is what i saw , lots of fish .
so the fisher@@ men are catching more .
so how much of this do we have ?
which takes us to the third reason , why we don &apos;t have many more reserves , is that the funding models have been wrong .
so , basically , the production sur@@ plus of these guys down there is enough to maintain this biomass that is not moving .
and there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global ecosystem .
we use the sub@@ marine al@@ vin and we use cameras , and the cameras are something that bill lan@@ ge has developed with the help of son@@ y .
they &apos;re very little understood .
and there &apos;s tens of thousands of those mountains out there that haven &apos;t been ma@@ pped yet .
what we find out now is that it &apos;s probably coming from inside the earth .
there are never any lights there , except the lights that we bring .
they don &apos;t need the sun at all .
b@@ l : this bacteria that we &apos;ve been talking about turns out to be the most simplest form of life found .
el n@@ ino comes and goes . it &apos;s not a disaster , it &apos;s rhyth@@ mic .
this is what we would love students to re@@ tain , even if they don &apos;t go into mathematical fields .
i believe in real life .
and then as we start to define what does ste@@ ep@@ ness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down , specifically what that means .
how long will it take it to fill it up ?
and why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-@@ quality curriculum in our front pocket .
the lesson of brian &apos;s presentation , in a way -- all those fantastic pictures -- is this really : that van@@ tage point determines everything that you see .
it was boring .
so the challenges of education in this kind of place are not to learn the kings and que@@ ens of kenya or britain .
what do they look like ?
waiting 10 years for the pa@@ yo@@ ff from education is too long when you need to meet daily needs , when you &apos;ve got si@@ blin@@ gs to look after or a business to help with .
that &apos;s one city .
and there will be no mistakes . &quot;
you &apos;d need millions and millions of teachers in china , india , nigeria and the rest of developing world to meet need .
but it is , unlike cars , which have developed so rapidly and or@@ derly , actually the school system is recogn@@ iz@@ ably an inher@@ it@@ ance from the 19th century , from a bi@@ smar@@ ki@@ an model of german scho@@ oling that got taken up by english re@@ for@@ mers , and often by religious mission@@ aries , taken up in the united states as a force of social co@@ he@@ sion , and then in japan and south korea as they developed .
so as i &apos;m watching this , i see this powerful scene that brought me to tears , and it stuck with me for the past 25 years .
and because i have a 15@@ -year-old , all i do is cook and cook and cook .
it &apos;s really scary , this gay lifestyle thing ; it &apos;s super du@@ per evil and there &apos;s no end to it !
the u.s. constitu@@ tion is the gay agenda .
but when you see the map , and you see our state of mich@@ ig@@ an -- it &apos;s legal to fire someone for being gay , le@@ s@@ bian , bi@@ sexual or trans@@ gen@@ dered , that it &apos;s legal to remove someone from their home because they &apos;re gay , le@@ s@@ bian , bi@@ sexual or trans@@ gen@@ dered , then you realize that this whole conversation about marriage equality is not about stri@@ pping someone &apos;s rights away , it &apos;s about gran@@ ting them the rights that &#91; have &#93; already been stated .
thank you .
some of the studies even say we &apos;re happier .
entropy means that everything in the world , everything , is in a state of decline and deca@@ y , the ar@@ ch .
how was i supposed to live it ?
if however , we can go back and al@@ ter our relationship , re-@@ vision our relationship to past people and events , neural pathways can change .
i know what &apos;s on your mind when you &apos;re looking at these pictures .
they have to try and attract pollin@@ ators to do their bi@@ dding .
it &apos;s a wonderful , amazing thing .
this is the philo@@ den@@ dron sel@@ lou@@ m .
last week i took these pictures of rock rose , heli@@ an@@ the@@ mu@@ m , in dor@@ set .
maybe you &apos;re tic@@ ked off , or maybe you &apos;re looking forward to a new game . you &apos;ve been up too late playing a game .
and he goes all around the country taking pictures of himself , and you can see here he &apos;s got zi@@ g &apos;s indian reser@@ vation . and this particular shot , this is one of the more traditional shots . this is a rain dan@@ cer .
and she says , &quot; they want to go . &quot; and i said , &quot; honey , no they don &apos;t want to go . this is the middle passage .
this is a game with 50,000 individual pieces .
what you &apos;re looking at is airplane traffic over north america for a 24@@ -@@ hour period .
you see the holding patterns that start to develop in the bottom of the screen .
so they made this web service and said , &quot; any program@@ mer can write a piece of software and tap into the minds of thousands of people . &quot;
that gives you an idea of the different types of mo@@ ti@@ vations and dedi@@ cation .
so we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into 10,000 teen@@ y pieces , and we fed those into the mechanical tur@@ k .
you &apos;d be fed a simple audio clip .
but we knew we really needed the right person to kind of r@@ ally behind and build something for .
ak : so if you go to the website john@@ ny@@ ca@@ sh@@ proje@@ ct@@ .com , what you &apos;ll see is the video playing above .
win but@@ ler : now our lives are changing fast now our lives are changing fast hope that something pure can last hope that something pure can last ooh we used to wait ooh we used to wait ooh we used to wait sometimes it never came sometimes it never came still moving through the pain we used to wait for it we used to wait for it we used to wait for it ak : so i think , if there &apos;s one thing to take away from my talk today , it &apos;s that an interface can be a powerful narrative device .
and it &apos;s also just getting to the essential of things .
so if you don &apos;t know one of these languages , it &apos;s instant learning .
here it &apos;s &quot; cand@@ y@@ city . &quot;
and parallel to my cutting is my running .
it &apos;s not auto@@ bio@@ graphical identi@@ ties .
so for the subway in new york , i saw a correspon@@ dence between riding the subway and reading .
so it acts as a screen to protect the ra@@ il and the commu@@ ter , and not to have objects falling on the ra@@ ils .
b@@ é@@ at@@ rice cor@@ on : stories cut from paper
now , the opposite of a s@@ no@@ b is your mother .
en@@ vy , it &apos;s a real tabo@@ o to mention en@@ vy , but if there is one dominant emotion in modern society , that is en@@ vy .
there is another reason why we might be feeling more anxi@@ ous , about our care@@ ers , about our status in the world today , than ever before .
but i think it &apos;s insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genu@@ inely mer@@ it@@ o@@ cra@@ tic . it &apos;s an impossible dream .
now is there any alternative to this ?
and so we tend to wor@@ ship ourselves .
psycho@@ analysis has been dru@@ m@@ ming home this message for about 80 years .
because otherwise it can get quite cla@@ u@@ stro@@ pho@@ bic .
and i decided the reme@@ dy to all this mal@@ a@@ ise was going to be for me to chase an elev@@ ated dream , an extreme dream , something that would require u@@ tter convic@@ tion and un@@ wa@@ vering passion , something that would make me be my best self in every aspect of my life , every minute of every day , because the dream was so big that i couldn &apos;t get there without that kind of behavior and that kind of convic@@ tion .
the navi@@ gation is difficult .
and i couldn &apos;t wait to trip the mind fantastic .
and every one of those bar@@ bs is sending that ven@@ om into this central nervous system .
and i swa@@ m through the night and i swa@@ m through the next day .
and a little kid from the back was like this .
yeah .
thank you . thank you .
and what about sleep ?
this is a device that not only measures car@@ dia@@ c rhythm , as you saw already , but it also goes well beyond that .
that looks like this .
it &apos;s usually 90 percent . so , you tell me you sleep better than expected .
now , diabetes is one of the big ones .
there are two things that can really accelerate this whole process .
so , i hope i &apos;ve convinced you of this , of the impact on hospital clinic resources is profound and then the impact on diseases is equally impressive across all these different diseases and more .
how do we make stable societies ? longevity .
and you get to think about yourself and your memories , and before you go back into susp@@ en@@ sion , you ed@@ it your memories and you change your personality and so forth .
and , of course , we &apos;re not responsible for the consequences of what we &apos;re doing now , are we ? like all this compla@@ int about clon@@ es .
thank you .
so we tried , and i &apos;ll show you what we came up with .
so you can la@@ vi@@ sh all the same care , all the same technique , on a ham@@ burger as you would on some much more fancy dish .
so it &apos;s very much like in a hollywood movie where a guy flies through the air , supported by wires , and then they take the wires away dig@@ it@@ ally so you &apos;re flying through the air .
that hor@@ n-@@ shaped region is what we call the sweet spot .
and because people watch my@@ th@@ bu@@ sters and c@@ si , i thought , well , let &apos;s put in a recipe for a bal@@ li@@ stics gel@@ a@@ tin .
but maybe if i cut a hole in his head i can fix it . &quot;
i mean who would put themselves through that ?
la@@ par@@ o@@ scop@@ y is doing this kind of surgery : surgery with long instruments through small inci@@ sions .
and now , in contrast to the la@@ par@@ o@@ scop@@ y , you can precisely place the needle in your instruments , and you can pass it all the way through and follow it in a trajectory .
and you need to re-@@ set it up .
we get to write the script of the next revolution in surgery .
we can he@@ al the disease .
we realized that when plastics get to the du@@ mp , it &apos;s difficult to sort them because they have similar den@@ sities , and when they &apos;re mixed with organic matter and construction de@@ bris , it &apos;s truly impossible to pick them out and environ@@ mentally eliminate them .
not only do ph@@ thal@@ ates pollu@@ te our environment , but they also pollu@@ te our bodies .
this means that our bacteria were actually living off of ph@@ thal@@ ates .
thank you . j@@ y : thank you .
but people live on this land .
this is an unusual installation of airport se@@ ating .
its early version had an &quot; x &quot; base . that &apos;s what the collec@@ tors like .
here &apos;s a film we &apos;ve been hearing things about .
so we &apos;re going to watch another film .
so , &quot; i saw many trains and also ro@@ de on one .
and there are a lot of fun things . this is the museum of the ben@@ ch .
it &apos;s about how you approach problems . and there is this huge , beautiful common@@ ality between design , business and the world .
that &apos;s what we all need to do .
it was mind-@@ blowing .
but if corruption cre@@ e@@ ps in and people don &apos;t have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law , then if you can use violence , if you can use violence with imp@@ unity , you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery .
so , that &apos;s a scenario that we think we should be capit@@ alizing on .
these young boys are in ne@@ pal .
liber@@ ation , however , costs some money .
children resc@@ u@@ ed from slavery in the fishing industry in ghana , re@@ united with their parents , and then taken with their parents back to their villages to rebuild their economic well-being so that they become sla@@ ve-@@ proof -- absolutely un@@ en@@ sla@@ ve@@ able .
however , only recently , due to several technological advan@@ ce@@ ments , we are now able to demonstrate to you quantum lev@@ itation and quantum lo@@ cking .
well , first there are strands of magnetic field left inside , but now the super@@ conductor doesn &apos;t like them moving around , because their movements dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate energy , which breaks the super@@ conduc@@ tivity state .
now , i can extend this cir@@ cular mag@@ net , and make whatever track i want .
and it was also inspired by this quote from dou@@ gl@@ as ad@@ ams , and the situation is from &quot; the hit@@ ch@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s guide to the galaxy . &quot;
but anyway , i got my su@@ it@@ case of iron ore and dra@@ gged it back to london on the train , and then was faced with the problem : okay , how do you make this rock into components for a to@@ a@@ ster ?
and the last material i &apos;m going to talk about today is plastic , and , of course , my to@@ a@@ ster had to have a plastic case .
that &apos;s it without the case on .
when i was a student at mit , we all shared one computer that took up a whole building .
so we up@@ dated them , so i could present it here , to 2007 .
communication technologies : 50 different ways to measure this , the number of bits being moved around , the size of the internet .
and we will begin to actually deeply influence our health and our intelligence , as we get closer and closer to this technology .
this was in an area called wel@@ la@@ wat@@ ta , a prime resi@@ dential area in col@@ om@@ bo .
for hours afterwards , the sea was stre@@ wn with bits of wood for miles around -- all of this was from the houses in the slu@@ m .
voice 1 : it &apos;s coming again . voice 2 : new wave ?
and it &apos;s one that offers really interesting possibilities for organizing a whole host of activities down the road .
it is very easy to fall in love with the de@@ centralized , bottom@@ -up structure of the internet .
and there &apos;s this famous example of one that was 1,@@ 200 feet long and la@@ sted for two days , and the ants just kept mar@@ ching around and around in a circle until they died .
i keep thinking about these kids with no arms .
i &apos;m going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this that we demonstrated in washington . can we look at this thing ?
it all began when two scientists , f@@ red grass@@ le and j@@ es@@ se au@@ su@@ bel , met in woods hole , mass@@ achu@@ set@@ ts where both were gu@@ ests at the fam@@ ed oce@@ ano@@ graphic institute .
and with sal@@ ting , it became possible to store fish and to transport it long distances .
and so one of the tools that we can use to sample the oceans is acou@@ stics , or sound waves .
well what they found was mis@@ labeled fish .
this is something we &apos;ve actually known for a while , so it &apos;s not a real breakthrough .
but the really interesting thing about it is that , a few years ago , census scientists discovered that this guy can thri@@ ve in oxy@@ gen@@ -@@ poor se@@ di@@ ments in the deep med@@ iter@@ ran@@ e@@ an sea .
so we still have quite a lot of work to do in terms of un@@ know@@ ns .
and the oceans are so productive , there &apos;s so much going on in there that &apos;s of relev@@ ance to humans that we really need to , even from a selfish perspective , try to do better than we have in the past .
and we do something different than what we did in the past ; we add kind of a modi@@ cu@@ m of intelligence to that .
you know , i am so bad at tech that my daughter -- who is now 4@@ 1 -- when she was five , was over@@ heard by me to say to a friend of h@@ ers , if it doesn &apos;t ble@@ ed when you cut it , my d@@ addy doesn &apos;t understand it .
the in@@ do@@ -@@ european root of the word hope is a stem , k-@@ e-@@ u -- we would spell it k-@@ e-@@ u ; it &apos;s p@@ ron@@ oun@@ ced ko@@ y -- and it is the same root from which the word curve comes from .
and i think that it &apos;s going to be , in time , the elements of the human spirit that we &apos;ve been hearing about bit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days .
we are , should be , mor@@ ally committed to being the heal@@ er of the world .
now that &apos;s not quite true . there &apos;s one other way , and that &apos;s through swe@@ ating .
now why is that top problem so easy and the bottom problem so hard ?
you send a command down , it causes muscles to contract .
so what are beliefs ?
and what ba@@ yes &apos; rule says is that i should multiply the numbers on the red by the numbers on the green to get the numbers of the yellow , which have the el@@ li@@ p@@ ses , and that &apos;s my belief .
now there &apos;s good reason to believe that you would want to be able to distingu@@ ish external events from internal events .
as you go from 0.@@ 1 to 0.@@ 2 , it becomes more tic@@ k@@ lish at the end .
we started with a motor with a little le@@ ver , a little force trans@@ f@@ user .
so i have a huge amount of choice to make .
if i choose a different way of moving -- on the right for example -- then i &apos;ll have a different command , different noise , playing through a no@@ isy system , very complicated .
you have to study vision with the realization of how the movement system is going to use vision .
and yes , the red planet is red .
here are some recent images .
and what we &apos;re looking at is the presence of the gas methane , ch@@ 4 , in the atmosphere of mars .
in the southern hemisphere there are impact cr@@ aters , there are volcan@@ ic cr@@ aters .
we will fly where the methane is .
we believe that in a one-@@ hour flight we can re@@ write the text@@ book on mars by making high-@@ resolution measurements of the atmosphere , looking for gases of bio@@ gen@@ ic origin , looking for gases of volcan@@ ic origin , studying the surface , studying the magne@@ tism on the surface , which we don &apos;t understand , as well as about a dozen other areas .
if you &apos;re interested in more information , we have a website that describes this exciting and intriguing mission , and why we want to do it .
i was like , &quot; yeah .
then you notice that if that le@@ go@@ -@@ provided ca@@ d program isn &apos;t enough , there &apos;s an entire open-source , thir@@ d-@@ party , independent lego ca@@ d program that lets you do 3d mode@@ ling and 3d ren@@ dering and make , in fact , movies out of lego , 3d films of which there are thousands on youtube , and some of them sort of mi@@ mic@@ king famous films and some totally original content -- just beautiful -- and people re@@ creating all sorts of things .
i &apos;m really scared . i don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to make it .
so , look what they did .
but the pa@@ y-@@ off is really enormous .
california em@@ its only seven percent of u.s. co2 emissions .
every year a million and a half people die of a completely prev@@ ent@@ able disease . that &apos;s malaria . 6,000 people a day .
do you know , they only invested 0.@@ 2 percent of reven@@ ues in r &amp; amp ; d ?
it could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century .
every dot is a person .
because , as i said , we live our lives in networks , and these networks have a particular kind of a structure .
so , if we want to track something that was spreading through a network , what we ide@@ ally would like to do is to set up sensors on the central individuals within the network , including no@@ de a , monitor those people that are right there in the middle of the network , and somehow get an early detection of whatever it is that is spreading through the network .
so , we thought we would exploit this idea in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks .
and the size of the dots is going to be propor@@ tional to how many of their friends have the flu .
and the answer is no .
and there are three ways , i think , that these ma@@ ssi@@ ve-@@ passive data can be used .
over the past seven years , i &apos;ve been following my fas@@ c@@ ination with the built environment , and for those of you who know me , you would say that this obse@@ ssion has led me to live out of a su@@ it@@ case 3@@ 65 days a year .
and you even find a church .
today , they live in this area , approximately 50,000 to 7@@ 0,000 people , who live in this community of self-@@ built multi-@@ story houses where up to three generations live in one structure .
in a region famous for the soft , po@@ rous lo@@ ess plat@@ ea@@ u soil , there lived until recently an estimated 40 million people in these houses underground .
so you know how it ended up , sp@@ en@@ cer tr@@ acy brought a computer , a ma@@ infra@@ me computer of 195@@ 7 , in to help the libr@@ arians .
on the right are some tu@@ gs from a company called a@@ eth@@ on in pit@@ ts@@ burgh .
so a person that &apos;s interacting with the robot understands where it &apos;s going to reach and isn &apos;t surprised by its mo@@ tions .
mil@@ dre@@ d &apos;s a factory worker in connec@@ ti@@ cut .
and turned up the other way , the people who are retirement age goes up very , very fast , as the baby boom@@ ers get to retirement age .
the system measures the beam &apos;s time of flight , recording the time it takes for the light to hit a surface and make its return .
and here , this is a fl@@ y-@@ through the cloud of points of ti@@ k@@ al , and here you see it ren@@ dered and photo@@ -@@ tex@@ tured with the photography that we take of the site .
last march , we received very sad news .
ben k@@ ac@@ y@@ ra : ancient won@@ ders captured in 3d
we had ho@@ lo@@ cau@@ st education in the schools .
it will refer you directly to your congre@@ ss@@ person , to your u.s. sen@@ ator , to your gover@@ nor where di@@ ve@@ st@@ ment legislation is pen@@ ding .
european governments , for the most part , haven &apos;t ac@@ knowle@@ dged responsibility , and there &apos;s nothing to kind of to push back and up against .
he was bo@@ bby ken@@ ne@@ d@@ y-@@ like because in some ways one could never tell if he was a re@@ alist ma@@ squ@@ er@@ ading as an ide@@ alist or an ide@@ alist ma@@ squ@@ er@@ ading as a re@@ alist , as people always wondered about bo@@ bby ken@@ ne@@ dy and john ken@@ ne@@ dy in that way .
but , u@@ h@@ -@@ oh , the kil@@ lers are within the camps .
you &apos;re un-@@ owned .
don &apos;t black@@ -@@ box history . don &apos;t check your principles at the door .
fourth and final point : he somehow , because he was working in all the world &apos;s worst places and all less@@ er ev@@ ils , had a hu@@ mil@@ ity , of course , and an awareness of the complexity of the world around him .
some are driven by compassion , feel it &apos;s perhaps one of the fundamental acts of humanity .
a hundred years ago , we didn &apos;t .
and yet , in many places , a third of the children , by the time they &apos;re three already are facing a life of hard@@ ship due to this .
and these types of technologies , i see , have the potential to transform the face of hunger and nutrition , mal@@ nutrition out on the front lines .
well two years ago , we decided , let &apos;s transform the model of fighting hunger , and instead of giving out the food aid , we put it into food banks .
it is a win@@ -@@ win@@ -@@ win situation that starts the food economy moving .
well , the world bank estimates it would take about 10 billion dollars -- 10@@ .@@ 3 -- to address mal@@ nutrition in those countries .
so , this is an ast@@ ounding table .
as one gets older ? very , very common .
why ? because we know what you have , and we know how to treat it -- although we can &apos;t make vaccine in this country , but that &apos;s a different story .
and i think that &apos;s been the fundamental problem over the last five decades , is that we have stri@@ ved to understand cancer .
and so , if you think of cancer as a system , there &apos;s an input and an output and a state in the middle .
if i give a woman with breast cancer a drug called tax@@ ol every three weeks , which is the standard , about 40 percent of women with meta@@ static cancer have a great response to that drug .
so , instead of a reduc@@ tion@@ ist view , we &apos;re taking a step back .
the problem is that , if i &apos;m this do@@ c , and i get your ct scan today and you &apos;ve got a two centi@@ meter mass in your liver , and you come back to me in three months and it &apos;s three centi@@ meters , did that drug help you or not ?
and so , as a cancer doctor , instead of having paper in my chart , in your chart , and it being this thick , this is what data flow is starting to look like in our offices , where that drop of blood is creating gi@@ g@@ aby@@ tes of data .
most people find that very so@@ o@@ thing , and , interestingly , 12 cycles per minute is roughly the frequency of the breathing of a sleeping human .
so if i were to play this -- -- for more than a few seconds , you &apos;d feel uncomfortable ; for more than a few minutes , you &apos;d be leaving the room in dro@@ ves .
you all recognize that one . this is the mo@@ st-@@ played tune in the world today .
and i stood there be@@ side two very good friends of mine , richard web@@ er and kevin val@@ le@@ ly .
so we would have a live website , that every single day of the 33 days , we would be blogging , telling stories of , you know , de@@ ple@@ ted o@@ zone for@@ cing us to cover our faces , or we will burn .
that i &apos;m this u@@ ber@@ -@@ end@@ ur@@ ance guy ?
i actually love diving at night ; you see a lot of fish then that you don &apos;t see in the day@@ time .
no matter where on earth you live .
we can go actually and swim around on google earth and visit with hu@@ mp@@ back whales .
we kill using long lines , with ba@@ ited hoo@@ ks every few feet that may stretch for 50 miles or more .
and , in 197@@ 2 , this nation began to estab@@ lish a counter@@ part in the sea , national marine san@@ c@@ tu@@ aries .
but , nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean .
without insects , there &apos;d be no flo@@ wer@@ ing plants .
they have another set of eyes on the top of their head .
a mouse has about 1,000 times as many neurons as a fly .
and these are the two concepts i &apos;d like to explore .
so this is the preparation that one of my former post-@@ do@@ cs , g@@ ab@@ y ma@@ im@@ on , who &apos;s now at rocke@@ fel@@ ler , developed , and it &apos;s basically a flight simul@@ ator but under conditions where you actually can stick an electro@@ de in the brain of the fly and record from a genetically identified neuron in the fly &apos;s brain .
the first is , it &apos;s essential for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society , and i think that it is a key step in evolution .
so i can say , with some certainty , &quot; i think , therefore i am . &quot;
we &apos;re just pac@@ king in colum@@ ns , so that we &apos;d have more neo@@ cor@@ tical colum@@ ns to perform more complex functions .
and we did that for tens of thousands of neurons , built digital models of all the different types of neurons we came across .
and when we do that what we discovered is that the circu@@ it@@ ry does change .
now , when you look at that the first time , you think , &quot; my god . how is reality coming out of that ? &quot;
this took place in my childhood -- 195@@ 7 to &apos; 65 .
&quot; space@@ ship project offici@@ ally begun . job waiting for you . dy@@ son . &quot;
so , these are three-@@ pound charges of c@@ 4 ; that &apos;s about 10 times what the guy had in his shoes .
this is a 20 man version for going to ju@@ pit@@ er : bun@@ ks , storm cel@@ lars , exercise room .
you know , i don &apos;t know how many of those you read , but it &apos;s not fun to read and often not fun to write -- even worse to write .
which i think is just fascinating .
very very hard .
giving your organs to somebody else is probably about how much you care about society , how linked you are .
interestingly enough , when people get this , they again don &apos;t check -- but now they join .
this is from a paper by re@@ del@@ me@@ ier and sc@@ ha@@ ef@@ er .
there is one more decision .
a print sub@@ scri@@ ption for 1@@ 25 .
and because we don &apos;t know our prefer@@ ences that well we &apos;re su@@ sc@@ ep@@ tible to all of these influ@@ ences from the external forces : the de@@ fa@@ ul@@ ts , the particular options that are presented to us , and so on .
the silver lin@@ ing is , i think , kind of the reason that behavioral economics is interesting and exciting .
they are scar@@ ce ; they are expensive ; and we only have a certain range of it .
and then we have the radio waves , they have the issues i &apos;ve just mentioned .
and this is a fundamental basic property that we exploit with our technology .
you think , &quot; ha , ha , ha .
and then i &apos;ve mentioned the avail@@ ability .
and then you have these millions of street la@@ mps deployed around the world .
you &apos;ve heard of dna ; you probably studied a little bit in biology .
and look at all the complex things and wonderful things we &apos;ve been able to create with just a one and a zero .
and then james wat@@ son &apos;s -- one of the co-@@ foun@@ ders of dna -- genome was done for two million dollars , and in just two months .
an architect far better and smarter than us has given us that to@@ ol@@ box , and we now have the ability to use it .
we could produce better fla@@ vors and ar@@ om@@ as .
and he had the best answer i ever heard to this question : &quot; well , somebody has to . &quot;
i &apos;m sni@@ ff@@ ing this other dog &apos;s re@@ ar end , the owner &apos;s calling . &quot;
and what you will find is a very , very low-@@ ran@@ king bit@@ ch will quite easily keep a bone away from a high-@@ ran@@ king male .
and that &apos;s how we use the food l@@ ure in the hand , and we use food because we &apos;re dealing with owners .
so we go , &quot; sit , &quot; on the cou@@ ch ; &quot; sit , &quot; tum@@ my@@ -@@ ru@@ b ; &quot; sit , &quot; look , i throw a ten@@ nis ball ; &quot; sit , &quot; say hello to that other dog .
they think a punishment is something nasty .
your head now is 100 yards away , sa@@ iling through the air , ok ?
and ugly face is this -- when you go fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face with a pu@@ ppy or a child , you say , &quot; what are you doing ! now stop it , stop it , stop it ! &quot;
it really is .
speaking at the 2007 e@@ g conference , tra@@ in@@ er ian dun@@ bar asks us to see the world through the eyes of our be@@ loved dogs . by knowing our pets &apos; perspective , we can build their love and trust . it &apos;s a message that reson@@ ates well beyond the animal world .
and you made it out of what ?
w@@ k : yeah , i want to build another one -- to pump water and ir@@ ri@@ gation for crops .
and so this is basically a song about lo@@ ops , but not the kind of lo@@ ops that i make up here .
and that &apos;s what the song is asking .
every time i read che@@ k@@ ho@@ v and his unique vision of human life , i &apos;m reminded of why i too became a writer .
what about bigger numbers ?
that &apos;s a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math , i &apos;m sure .
the h@@ are itself , the animal -- not a cat , not a dog , a h@@ are -- why a h@@ are ?
how did we become the only species that becomes more prosper@@ ous as it becomes more popu@@ l@@ ous ?
and it &apos;s this combination , this cu@@ mu@@ lative technology , that intrigu@@ es me , because i think it &apos;s the secret to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world .
there &apos;s no exchange of ideas between them .
and that &apos;s seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you &apos;ve gained since 19@@ 50 , as it were , because that &apos;s seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else , or you can acquire another good or service .
we &apos;re able to draw upon speci@@ alization and exchange to raise each other &apos;s living standards .
and so both sides raise each other &apos;s standards of living through the sexual division of labor .
and that will have led to speci@@ alization .
the person on the assembly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic , and so on .
my work is about the behaviors that we all engage in un@@ consciously , on a collective level .
and that &apos;s gone up since then , but we don &apos;t have the numbers yet .
and this is what the next piece is about .
as we try to build this view , and try to educate ourselves about the enor@@ m@@ ity of our culture , the information that we have to work with is these gi@@ gan@@ tic numbers : numbers in the millions , in the hundreds of millions , in the billions and now in the tril@@ lions .
you &apos;re looking at the outside shell of the virus , and the yellow color here are those parts of the virus that are evolving very , very fast , and the blue parts are not evolving very fast .
but really , it &apos;s pretty robust .
and there &apos;re only 10@@ 2 because people got bored collecting them : there are just new ones every year .
so that &apos;s great , but again , cheap shot , right ?
we put the bee@@ per in the clinic .
i mean , they went to the ma@@ x for this woman .
and what i &apos;m telling you here from the signal , is that men who have a mutation in this anti@@ viral defense enzy@@ me , and have a tumor , often have -- 40 percent of the time -- a signature which reveals a new retro@@ virus .
joe der@@ is@@ i : solving medical my@@ ster@@ ies
here &apos;s the first battery -- a stack of co@@ ins , z@@ in@@ c and silver , separated by car@@ d@@ board so@@ a@@ ked in br@@ ine .
the electro@@ ly@@ te is not a solution of salt and water , but rather salt that &apos;s mel@@ ted .
it &apos;s pretty cool , at least in theory .
so a year and a half ago , david and i , along with another research sta@@ ff@@ -@@ member , formed a company to accelerate the rate of progress and the race to manufac@@ ture product .
don@@ ald sa@@ do@@ way : the missing link to renewable energy
so i want to give you a quick story of how it got started .
did you find the gold ?
things where you might trip across things like the c@@ oper@@ ni@@ can principle , the fer@@ mi paradox , the anthro@@ pi@@ c principle , the origin of life .
so pretty much players are encouraged to be very creative in the game .
so this is the planet that we &apos;ve been playing on up to this point in the game .
now here , our entire oceans are eva@@ por@@ ating off the surface , and as it keeps getting hot@@ ter at some point the entire planet &apos;s going to melt down .
and so you &apos;d have this wonderful spar@@ k@@ ling thing , with the dis@@ k slowly rot@@ ating , and this is roughly what it would look like . and so really , part of this is about bringing the beauty of this , of the natural world , to somebody in a very imag@@ in@@ ative way , so that they can start cali@@ br@@ ating their instin@@ ct across these vast scales of space and time .
even the bb@@ c and the new york times .
so they do this both when they have power sort of chron@@ ically , and also when they &apos;re feeling powerful in the moment .
so business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap .
probably not , right ? you want the person who &apos;s powerful and as@@ ser@@ tive and dominant , but not very stress re@@ active , the person who &apos;s laid back .
so two minutes lead to these hor@@ mon@@ al changes that con@@ figure your brain to basically be either as@@ ser@@ tive , confident and comfortable , or really stre@@ ss-@@ re@@ active , and , you know , feeling sort of shut down . and we &apos;ve all had the feeling , right ?
we also evalu@@ ate these people much more posi@@ tively overall . &quot;
and the night before my first-@@ year talk , and the first-@@ year talk at prin@@ ce@@ ton is a 20-@@ minute talk to 20 people . that &apos;s it .
two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
so you &apos;re out in the woods , or you &apos;re out in the pa@@ sture , and you see this ant cra@@ wling up this bla@@ de of grass .
many people have laid down their lives for commun@@ ism , and many have laid down their lives for capitalism .
now , what theories do we want to use to look at this ?
not silicon .
there are other paras@@ ites that do this -- which ren@@ der the host steri@@ le .
they &apos;re not a big deal for us .
now in the old days , conduc@@ ting , music making , was less about trust and more , frankly , about co@@ erci@@ on .
i have to say , in those days , i couldn &apos;t really even find the bird .
they don &apos;t read music .
do you hear it ?
well done , ladies and gentlemen .
lyn : when i &apos;m making music , i feel like a pilot in the cock@@ pit flying an airplane .
my uncle ed gave me a beautiful blue swe@@ ater -- at least i thought it was beautiful .
we focused on a business model ; we insi@@ sted on skin in the game .
they are farmers and factory workers .
it &apos;s estimated that africa lo@@ ses about 13 billion dollars a year to the disease .
she runs two of the lines , and has already saved enough money to put a down pay@@ ment on her house .
well three sons got into a negoti@@ ation .
how do we deal with our deepest differences , given the human pro@@ pen@@ sity for conflict and the human genius at devi@@ sing weapons of enormous destruction ?
and we can play an incredibly construc@@ tive role .
now let me take you for a moment to what &apos;s widely regar@@ ded as the world &apos;s most difficult conflict , or the most impossible conflict , is the middle east .
now as anthropo@@ logists , we know that every culture has an origin story .
and that &apos;s what comes to the first step here .
let me ask you a question .
and so that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
but they did it thanks to a common identity -- europe -- and a common economy .
nat@@ ali@@ e mac@@ master : cape bre@@ ton fi@@ dd@@ ling in re@@ el time
first step , the medical doctor went away for about six months , and he worked on what were to become these nine health goals , what were we a@@ im@@ ing at .
you and your kids are fine .
that &apos;s our average budget .
they do all aspects of the work .
they could tra@@ p the flies , send them to him in per@@ th .
i put it to you , is this eli@@ minating poverty ?
so when i do my job , people hate me .
and second , i don &apos;t care about the word , i care about how you use it .
i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s easy .
but it all starts with seeds in classrooms , in my place , which looks like this .
and what &apos;d we do then ? well , i met nice people like you , and they invited us to the ha@@ mp@@ tons .
that &apos;s a picture i took of my bronx bor@@ ough president , addressing my kids in his house , not the ja@@ il@@ house , making them feel a part of it .
so we started giving back .
and when you expand their pal@@ ates , you expand their vocabu@@ lary .
and again , when you can take kids from back@@ grounds as diverse as this to do something as special as this , we &apos;re really creating a moment .
people , you can all do that .
s@@ í se pu@@ e@@ de !
well , with the pig , at the ba@@ sel@@ ine , before we blo@@ cked the pig &apos;s arter@@ y to simul@@ ate a heart attack , that was the signal .
so there it was , th@@ ur@@ s@@ day morning we stopped the pig &apos;s medication and there is his electro@@ gram , the signal from inside the pig &apos;s heart coming out by radio tele@@ me@@ try .
that &apos;s the first invention that i wanted to describe .
st@@ acy sa@@ ger : but for christ@@ ina side@@ bottom , almost anything was worth trying if it could stop a migra@@ ine .
this is probably a better picture .
a signal in the brain that trig@@ gers brain dys@@ function might be sen@@ sed as a trigger for electro@@ -@@ stimulation like we &apos;re doing with epi@@ le@@ p@@ sy .
everybody knows that we can do better with a visual thing that can be interactive with the patient , where they see the video and they &apos;re being vide@@ o@@ ed and they press , do you understand this ? no , i don &apos;t .
and so there is a team of develo@@ pers from all over africa , who are part of this team now -- from ghana , from mal@@ aw@@ i , from kenya .
you see this with twitter , too . you get this information over@@ load .
after he died , i realized that no one writ@@ es to me anymore .
in fact , so many different points of reson@@ ance that it &apos;s going to be difficult to bring them all up , but i &apos;ll try to do my best .
think of it as a massive it@@ un@@ es for book type content .
companies like national instruments , who are embed@@ ding very powerful , interactive si@@ mu@@ lations into the materials , so that we can go way beyond our regular kind of text@@ book to an experience that all the teaching materials are things you can actually interact with and play around with and actually learn as you do .
so what we &apos;re seeing is moving this burning or publi@@ cation process from the regular sort of single-@@ auth@@ ored book towards commun@@ ity-@@ auth@@ ored materials that are modu@@ lar , that are custom@@ ized to each individual class and published on demand very in@@ expen@@ sively , either pushed out through amazon , or published directly through an on-@@ demand press , like coo@@ p .
and people who are teachers out here , whoever taught , you know this -- it &apos;s the inter@@ connections between ideas that teaching is really all about .
we &apos;re not talking about harry po@@ tter , right ?
and if you read the press , it actually last week said i quit the media lab .
and these are two an@@ ec@@ dot@@ es -- one was in cambo@@ dia , in a village that has no electricity , no water , no television , no telephone , but has broad@@ band internet now .
we &apos;re interested in big disp@@ lays , bright disp@@ lays .
it &apos;s the rest -- that little brown box -- that is pretty fascinating , because the rest of your laptop is de@@ voted to itself .
is it all worked out ? no .
by law you &apos;ve got to bi@@ d , and so on and so forth .
because there &apos;s no market for post office trucks .
and if it comes out at 13@@ 8 dollars , so what ?
we can put anything we want into it , and it doesn &apos;t get heavi@@ er , and then we can take anything out .
and i said , &quot; i want to do that . &quot;
these are the people that you have access to right now , in general -- all of these people , all of your friends and family that you can connect to .
i want you to take a trip with me .
in resour@@ ce@@ -@@ rich countries , with all the tests and treatment we currently have , less than two percent of babies are born hi@@ v-@@ positive -- 98 percent of babies are born hi@@ v-@@ negative .
these women are here for care , but we know that just doing a test , just giving someone a drug , it &apos;s not enough .
your baby is going to be hi@@ v-@@ negative . &quot;
the second : keep mothers healthy , keep mothers alive , keep the children alive -- no more or@@ ph@@ ans .
she had been asked by one of the clients to go to the home of the client , because the client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters about her hiv status , and she was afraid to go by herself .
we &apos;ve chosen to re@@ define the health care system as a doctor , a nurse and a mentor mother .
mothers with hiv caring for mothers with hiv .
it &apos;s propor@@ tionally much bigger in humans than in any other species , and it &apos;s involved in a whole range of high level cognitive functions , things like decision-making , planning , planning what you &apos;re going to do tomorrow or next week or next year , inhi@@ b@@ iting in@@ appropriate behavior , so stopping yourself saying something really ru@@ de or doing something really stupid .
there are three trucks there . you &apos;re going to instin@@ ctively go for the white truck , because that &apos;s the top truck from your perspective , but then you have to remember , &quot; oh , he can &apos;t see that truck , so he must mean me to move the blue truck , &quot; which is the top truck from his perspective . now believe it or not , normal , healthy , intelligent adults like you make errors about 50 percent of the time on that kind of trial .
but now we try to understand that in terms of the development of a part of their brain called the lim@@ bic system , so i &apos;m going to show you the lim@@ bic system in red in the slide behind me , and also on this brain .
see , he owned a chro@@ mi@@ um pl@@ ating company , and they had to move heavy steel parts between tan@@ ks of chemicals , and so he needed an industrial robot like this that could basically do the heavy li@@ fting .
but i knew what he meant , because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures of flowers in a garden and then , basically , index them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot when there wasn &apos;t .
she said , when she was just about to walk on stage , the tele@@ -@@ dire@@ ctors were still trying to agree on what to do , and so she just walked on stage and did what felt most natural .
human demon@@ strations , they &apos;re all no@@ isy and im@@ perfect , and we extract from them an in@@ fer@@ red task trajectory and control sequence for the robot .
the more that robots in@@ grain themselves into our everyday lives , the more we &apos;re forced to exam@@ ine ourselves as people . at ted@@ x@@ ber@@ ke@@ ley , ken gold@@ berg shares four very human lessons that he &apos;s learned from working with robots . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
in fact , it is said that in the collective consciousness of africa , we get to experience the deepest parts of our own humanity through our interactions with others .
and there was something so beautifully african about it to me , this small house with a huge heart in it .
as i come out of the water , sol@@ ly arri@@ ves at a deep section , a channel between us .
she arrived at our reserve from a reserve east of us on her migr@@ atory route .
and while it &apos;s true that u@@ bun@@ tu is an african idea , what i see is the essence of that value being invented here .
now ka@@ e@@ sa@@ va had a baby boy called re@@ han a couple of weeks ago .
perhaps loss of memory is so crucial for our survival as human beings .
well , when i think of the future , i never see myself moving forward in time . i actually see time moving back@@ ward towards me .
i actually included stories from my grandmother .
i must admit , i used to be one of them .
i discovered that there &apos;s a movement for a better way .
bir@@ ke ba@@ e@@ h@@ r : what &apos;s wrong with our food system
and you can see that it kind of ho@@ c@@ key sticks up around the 1960s and &apos; 70s , and it &apos;s on kind of a nice trajectory right now .
se@@ amounts are important for biodiversity .
and what &apos;s the context of the phoenix islands ?
i &apos;d like to go back and share it with the government of ki@@ ri@@ bat@@ i , who are over in tar@@ aw@@ a , the we@@ ster@@ n@@ most group .
it had occurred on land , in rain@@ forests of south america and africa , where lan@@ dow@@ ners had been paid not to cut the trees down .
it &apos;s almost like if a person has multiple diseases , it &apos;s hard to get well , you might die , but if you only have one disease to deal with , you can get better .
i &apos;ve just described to you the one story behind that re@@ ct@@ an@@ gu@@ lar area in the middle , the phoenix islands , but every other green pat@@ ch on that has its own story .
just in the past couple years , we &apos;ve seen digital tools display skills and abilities that they never , ever had before , and that , kind of , eat deeply into what we human beings do for a living . let me give you a couple examples .
in the short term , we can stimul@@ ate job growth by encouraging entreprene@@ ur@@ ship and by investing in infrastructure , because the robots today still aren &apos;t very good at fix@@ ing bridges .
so the work of innovation , the work of coming up with new ideas , is some of the most powerful , some of the most fundamental work that we can do in an economy . and this is kind of how we used to do innovation .
thanks very much .
this is 198@@ 3 .
and , la@@ stly , under &quot; harmony , &quot; they had this 13@@ th-@@ century man@@ dal@@ a from ti@@ bet .
he didn &apos;t want any of his friends to be arrested , so he supp@@ lied everybody with this fake volunteer card .
which brought me back to my list making -- you know , just to see what i actually like about my job .
then it &apos;s : &quot; gu@@ ts . &quot;
the other condition is in societies living in mar@@ gin@@ al or fluctu@@ ating environments , such as the arctic or deser@@ ts , where there are peri@@ o@@ dic food shor@@ tages , and occasionally there just isn &apos;t enough food to keep everyone alive .
for example , there &apos;s particular empha@@ sis on respect for the elderly in east asia , associated with con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us &apos; do@@ c@@ tr@@ ine of fi@@ li@@ al pie@@ ty , which means obe@@ di@@ ence , respect and support for elderly parents .
perhaps the biggest change for the worse is that our elderly are obje@@ ctively less useful than in traditional societies .
unfortunately , all of those terrible situations could come back .
those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies .
and so the back@@ story of the 99 takes place in 12@@ 5@@ 8 , which history tells us the mon@@ go@@ ls inv@@ aded ba@@ gh@@ dad and destroyed it .
the concept centers on something called the no@@ or stones .
i got ac@@ c@@ used in a few blogs that i was actually sent by the po@@ pe to pre@@ ach the trin@@ ity and catho@@ li@@ ci@@ sm in the middle east , so you -- you believe who you want . i gave you my version of the story .
top right is stu@@ art moore , a writer for iron man .
opened a theme park through a license in ku@@ wait a year and a half ago called the 99 village theme park -- 3@@ 00,000 square feet , 20 ri@@ des , all with our characters : a couple back@@ -to-@@ school licen@@ ses in spain and turkey .
i don &apos;t deserve it . i don &apos;t deserve anything .
and the first one was about a group called the party of god , who wanted to ban val@@ ent@@ ine &apos;s day . red was made illegal .
ra@@ yan re@@ fra@@ med the situation and brought himself down to my level .
that is , they &apos;re meaning@@ less without context : 500 billion for this pipeline , 20 billion for this war .
so i want to show you another landscape now .
why april ?
yeah , re@@ tail therapy might help .
there &apos;s something almost quite magical about visual information .
so massive , in fact , that it can contain all the other military bud@@ gets in the world inside itself .
we need relative figures that are connected to other data so that we can see a ful@@ ler picture , and then that can lead to us changing our perspective .
so let &apos;s filter that out .
i mean , i find information just too interesting .
now what you are smel@@ ling is a combination of -- i asked how many molecules there were in there , and nobody would tell me .
and that &apos;s a perfectly reasonable theory in the sense that almost everything else in biology works by shape .
this is ci@@ s-@@ 3@@ -@@ h@@ ex@@ en@@ e-@@ 1@@ -@@ ol . it smells of cut grass .
the bad news is they &apos;re rocket fuels .
this is the basis for the device that these two guys at ford built .
and i said , first of all , let me do the calcu@@ lation on that com@@ pound , bottom right , which is related to cou@@ mar@@ in , but has an extra pen@@ ta@@ gon in@@ ser@@ ted into the molecule .
i come out of the advertising and design business .
running through this typical letter that they had , i ran it through my simplicity lab , it &apos;s pretty un@@ intel@@ li@@ gible .
mo@@ ses ! -- the boys in michael mor@@ pur@@ go &apos;s &quot; friend or fo@@ e ; &quot; al@@ em in benjamin ze@@ ph@@ ani@@ ah &apos;s &quot; refugee boy ; &quot; lu@@ ke sky@@ wal@@ ker -- lu@@ ke sky@@ wal@@ ker ! -- o@@ liver tw@@ ist ; ca@@ ssi@@ a in &quot; the con@@ cu@@ b@@ ine of shanghai &quot; by hong ying ; ce@@ lie in al@@ ice wal@@ ker &apos;s &quot; the color purple . &quot;
the adoption process took , like , a matter of months , so it was a closed shop , you know , se@@ aled deal , an industri@@ ous , uti@@ lit@@ arian solution : the government , the farmer , the adop@@ ting parents , the consumer , the mother , the earth , and the child , the crop .
and i was on the cus@@ p of , sort of , adolescence , so i was starting to take bi@@ scu@@ its from the tin without asking .
but because i had no family to in@@ qui@@ re about me , they could do anything to me .
lem@@ n si@@ s@@ say : a child of the state
we still really haven &apos;t got a very complete picture of it .
and if you look north here , there &apos;s a big river that flows into the lake that &apos;s been carrying se@@ di@@ ment and pre@@ serving the remains of the animals that lived there .
and he remained there until 1.@@ 6 million years later , when this very famous fossil hun@@ ter , ka@@ mo@@ ya ki@@ me@@ u , walked along a small h@@ ill@@ side and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pe@@ bb@@ les , recognized it as being hom@@ in@@ id .
i think it &apos;s our collective intelligence .
well , to end on a very positive note , i think ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ arily speaking , this is probably a fairly good thing , in the end .
this fol@@ der has 17@@ ,000 photos -- over 20 gi@@ g@@ aby@@ tes of information -- and it &apos;s growing constantly .
you can see that i even made a museum label for it that includes a brief history of the do@@ do .
it &apos;s funny to me that it took a while to authenti@@ cate it , because i can see it compared to this thing , and i can tell you -- it &apos;s real , it &apos;s the real thing , it &apos;s made from the exact same mo@@ ld that this one is .
i &apos;ll go you one stran@@ ger than that : in 197@@ 4 , during the production of a weird comedy sequ@@ el to &quot; the mal@@ te@@ se fal@@ con , &quot; called &quot; the black bird , &quot; star@@ ring george se@@ gal , the los angeles county museum of art had a pla@@ ster original of the mal@@ te@@ se fal@@ con -- one of the original six pla@@ sters , i think , made for the movie -- stolen out of the museum . a lot of people thought it was a publi@@ city stun@@ t for the movie .
there &apos;s a thing that happens when you mo@@ ld and cast things , which is that every time you throw it into silic@@ one and cast it in res@@ in , you lose a little bit of volume , you lose a little bit of size .
i had exten@@ sive and life-@@ threat@@ ening inju@@ ries .
the next concern was whether i would walk again , because i was paralyzed from the wa@@ ist down .
i was lying on a thin , hard spinal bed .
in the spinal ward , that &apos;s normal .
it was everybody &apos;s pain . and then i knew , just like before , that i had a choice . i could keep fighting this or i could let go and accept not only my body but the circumstances of my life .
and they took one look and ran out the back to draw short stra@@ ws .
so i went home , i got a training di@@ ary out , and i had a plan .
the pilot light inside of me was still a light , just as it is in each and every one of us .
and we should be developing things -- we should be developing pack@@ aging for ideas which elev@@ ate people &apos;s per@@ ceptions and respect for the things that we dig out of the earth and translate into products for everyday use .
when i do make some money , i &apos;ll have one mach@@ ined for myself .
it comes back to instin@@ ct .
it cost 1.@@ 7 million dollars to develop . it &apos;s called &quot; go &quot; by ber@@ n@@ hard@@ t , usa .
that is the power of organic design .
it &apos;s grown in my mind , and then it &apos;s grown in terms of the whole process that i go through .
i &apos;ve been ban@@ ging on about this like i can &apos;t believe .
and that &apos;s what i do with my furniture .
it &apos;s in no@@ tting hill next to all the cra@@ p -- you know , the prostitu@@ tes and all that stuff .
on the wall is my book called &quot; super@@ natural , &quot; which allows me to remember what i &apos;ve done , because i forget .
we trained in a tank in port hu@@ ene@@ me , and then my first open ocean dive was in santa bar@@ bar@@ a channel .
like those big explo@@ sions , spar@@ ks , are from a little com@@ b jel@@ ly , and there &apos;s k@@ ri@@ ll and other kinds of cru@@ stac@@ e@@ ans , and jellyfish .
now , this one is blue , and that &apos;s the color of most biolumines@@ cence in the ocean because evolution has selected for the color that travels far@@ the@@ st through seawater in order to optimi@@ ze communication .
he &apos;s got to find himself a bab@@ e and then he &apos;s got to lat@@ ch on for life .
and then to generate the display you &apos;re about to see , all i did was touch it once per second on its nerve ring with a sharp pick that &apos;s sort of like the sharp to@@ oth of a fish .
but there came a moment when it all came together , and everything worked .
ed@@ ith wi@@ dder : glo@@ wing life in an underwater world
so as we are facing all the multiple cri@@ ses in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what &apos;s going to bring more joy , gra@@ titude , effe@@ c@@ tiveness in our lives and be the best for our own care@@ ers is also what is best for the world .
so i -- i took my camera , i took my no@@ te@@ book , took a chair , and started to observe this behavior .
here &apos;s one of my fellow win@@ ners . that &apos;s charles pa@@ x@@ ton who won the 2000 biology prize for his paper , &quot; cour@@ t@@ ship behavior of o@@ stri@@ ches towards humans under farming conditions in britain . &quot;
the mission@@ ary position is very rare in the animal kingdom .
and when it &apos;s over , we go to a chinese restaurant and we have a six-@@ course duck dinner .
it had become a part of my body , an extension of my senses , and after some time , it even became a part of my official image .
prince charles has some simil@@ arities with nic@@ o@@ le kid@@ man .
and the good thing about percei@@ ving ultra@@ violet is that you can hear if it &apos;s a good day or a bad day to sun@@ ba@@ the , because ultra@@ violet is a dangerous color , a color that can actually kill us , so i think we should all have this wish to perceive things that we cannot perceive .
she was wh@@ ol@@ ly un@@ concerned about the bears , but she was terrified of lawyers .
but the reality is , these crazy cases are relatively rare . they don &apos;t usually win .
it &apos;s very hard to measure because there are mixed mo@@ tives .
it doesn &apos;t seem to be working very well does it ?
people -- for law to be the platform for freedom , people have to trust it .
so , what &apos;s needed now is to rebuild these boundaries .
that person doesn &apos;t exist today .
it &apos;s the only way to get our freedom back , and it &apos;s the only way to release the energy and passion needed so that we can meet the challenges of our time . thank you .
or -- or maybe and -- in addition to rules , let &apos;s see if we can come up with some really clever incentives so that , even if the people we deal with don &apos;t particularly want to serve our interests , it is in their interest to serve our interest -- the magic incentives that will get people to do the right thing even out of pure sel@@ fish@@ ness .
well if you think about it , it &apos;s really hard to measure out round colum@@ ns using a rul@@ er .
he had a pretty low-@@ wage job .
he did after all have a toy gun .
but the problem with rel@@ ying on rules and incentives is that they de@@ mor@@ alize professional activity , and they de@@ mor@@ alize professional activity in two senses .
so can@@ ny out@@ laws are better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine any can@@ ny out@@ law susta@@ ining that for an inde@@ fin@@ ite period of time .
there are now 22 cities that have veter@@ ans &apos; cour@@ ts like this .
so there are lots of examples like this that we talk about .
the united states had developed a couple of atomic weapons through the manhattan project , and the idea was very straightforward : we would use the power of the atom to end the at@@ ro@@ cities and the horror of this un@@ ending world war ii that we &apos;d been involved in in europe and in the pacific .
during this chapter one , there was a high level of public awareness about the potential of nuclear catastro@@ p@@ he , and an inde@@ li@@ ble image was im@@ planted in our collective minds that , in fact , a nuclear ho@@ lo@@ cau@@ st would be absolutely globally de@@ struc@@ tive and could , in some ways , mean the end of civilization as we know it .
so the goal was to ev@@ acu@@ ate the target cities .
there are many , many sites where war@@ heads are stored and , in fact , lots of sites where fi@@ s@@ sion@@ able materials , like highly enri@@ ched ur@@ ani@@ um and plu@@ ton@@ ium , are absolutely not safe .
they are very dedicated and committed .
this is the size of the &quot; little boy &quot; bomb that was dropped at hi@@ ro@@ shim@@ a .
in that 10 to 15 minutes , all you have to do -- and i mean this seriously -- is go about a mile away from the b@@ last .
so separation -- hopefully with dirt or concrete , or being in a base@@ ment -- distance and time is what will save you .
serious problems , big problems , pressing problems .
and many of us here are deeply involved in that .
and that &apos;s clear@@ er now than it &apos;s been for decades .
that &apos;s what business does when it makes a profit .
business does not profit from causing social problems , actually not in any fundamental sense .
we see companies like the braz@@ i@@ lian fore@@ stry company fi@@ bri@@ a that &apos;s figured out how to avoid te@@ aring down old growth forest and using e@@ uc@@ aly@@ p@@ tus and getting much more yield per he@@ ct@@ are of pul@@ p and making much more paper than you could make by cutting down those old trees .
if we can break down this sort of divide , this une@@ ase , this tension , this sense that we &apos;re not fundamentally collabor@@ ating here in driving these social problems , we can break this down , and we finally , i think , can have solutions .
this shows a lot of internal structures .
it doesn &apos;t have to be always dis@@ section .
they &apos;re even more shocked by what he says .
they talked about science and the need for a new scientific revolution .
each month required 1,@@ 3@@ 65 calculations , so these tables were filled with mistakes .
there &apos;s a flip side as well .
one day a nasa man@@ ager comes into my office , sits down and says , &quot; can you please tell us , how do we look for life outside earth ? &quot;
so he was convinced , but , in fact , most people aren &apos;t .
and it is in fact due to this arms race between ha@@ ckers and operating system designers that things go back and forth .
and as you see here , there are groups that are growing on top of each other , because they are spreading .
and obviously each of these letters comes off about roughly equally frequ@@ ent .
it doesn &apos;t matter what kind of se@@ di@@ ment you &apos;re using to gr@@ ind up , whether it &apos;s bacteria or any other plants or animals .
so let &apos;s see what that looks like .
and if we remove the mystery of life , then i think it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live , and how perhaps we &apos;re not as special as we always think we are .
this is a paper form , and what you &apos;re looking at is a paper form in the hand of a ministry of health nurse in indonesia who is tra@@ mping out across the coun@@ try@@ side in indonesia on , i &apos;m sure , a very hot and hu@@ mi@@ d day , and she is going to be kno@@ cking on thousands of doors over a period of weeks or months , kno@@ cking on the doors and saying , &quot; excuse me , we &apos;d like to ask you some questions .
now try and wrap your head around that for a second .
the problem was , after a few years of doing that , i realized i had done -- i had been to maybe six or seven programs , and i thought , you know , if i keep this up at this pace , over my whole career , maybe i &apos;m going to go to maybe 20 or 30 programs .
now you may not think of hot@@ mail as being mirac@@ ulous , but for me it was mirac@@ ulous , because i noticed , just as i was wre@@ st@@ ling with this problem , i was working in sub-saharan africa mostly at the time .
but there are some additional benefits as well .
collecting global health data was an im@@ perfect science : workers tra@@ mped through villages to kno@@ ck on doors and ask questions , wrote the answers on paper forms , then input the data -- and from this ga@@ ppy information , countries would make huge decisions . data ge@@ ek jo@@ el sel@@ ani@@ ki@@ o talks through the sea change in collecting health data in the past decade -- starting with the palm pilot and hot@@ mail , and now moving into the cloud . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and when we drop the bal@@ last over@@ board we climb .
throwing over@@ board , as bal@@ last , to change our direction .
but we were expected to have doub@@ ts ; we &apos;re expected to have fears .
but it will not be possible in the future any more .
why that ? because fuel is not easy to replace .
and this is exactly the symbol of our world .
but much more , to get ad@@ vices , to give your comm@@ ents , to spread the word that if it &apos;s possible in the air , of course it &apos;s possible in the ground .
you see , it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song , you needed a studio and a produc@@ er .
don &apos;t ask .
and what we &apos;re facing in africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality .
you see , it &apos;s not as dramatic as the tsunami .
don &apos;t you think that on a pu@@ rely commercial level , that anti-@@ retro@@ viral drugs are great adverti@@ se@@ ments for western in@@ genu@@ ity and technology ?
this is the straight truth , the ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous truth .
so why , then , are we not pu@@ mping our fi@@ sts into the air ?
momentum has been building .
there &apos;s the continent africa .
a few minutes ago , i talked about all the citizens &apos; campaig@@ ns that are sp@@ r@@ inging up .
i really believe that old tru@@ man line , that if you give the american people the facts , they &apos;ll do the right thing .
i think we have the money and brains in the room to do that .
now , &quot; all sho@@ ok up &quot; is a great love song .
people with colored hearing actually see colors when they hear the sounds of words or letters .
they took longer to re@@ ject metaph@@ ors as false than they did to re@@ ject literally false sentences .
those exposed to the world war ii scenario made more interven@@ tion@@ ist recomm@@ en@@ dations than the others .
a@@ ph@@ or@@ ism enthusi@@ ast and author james ge@@ ary wa@@ xes on a fascinating fix@@ ture of human language : the metaphor . friend of scri@@ bes from aristotle to el@@ vis , metaphor can sub@@ tly influence the decisions we make , ge@@ ary says .
but we want to tell the world that , no , under the one flag , we &apos;ll still remain as ye@@ men@@ i people .
and he said , &quot; you are the bridge . &quot;
pm : and we should point out that he works with you as well at the paper .
we &apos;ve suffered pro@@ secu@@ tion ; the paper was closed down more than three times .
actually , that &apos;s a documentary that &apos;s available online ; the video &apos;s online .
as political tur@@ mo@@ il in yemen continues , the editor of the yemen times , na@@ dia al-@@ sa@@ k@@ ka@@ f , talks at ted@@ global with host p@@ at mit@@ ch@@ ell . al-@@ sa@@ k@@ ka@@ f &apos;s independent , eng@@ li@@ sh-@@ language paper is vital for sharing news -- and for sharing a new vision of yemen and of that country &apos;s women as equal partners in work and change .
my father and my grandfather were always looking for the ne@@ west thing in alternative or traditional therap@@ ies for ph , but after six months , i couldn &apos;t walk up a small hill . i couldn &apos;t climb a flight of stairs .
it certainly didn &apos;t prepare me for what came next .
my doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant .
but organs don &apos;t wait , and i went into surgery before i could say goodbye .
medical conditions don &apos;t ne@@ gate the human condition .
and many of these chemicals are now linked to the sky@@ rocke@@ ting inci@@ dents of chronic childhood disease that we &apos;re seeing across industri@@ alized nations .
and you can see these large , yo@@ l@@ ke@@ d-@@ up eggs bur@@ sting through the surface of this male &apos;s te@@ stes .
but just two weeks before that , the u.s. sen@@ ate ref@@ used to even debate the ban@@ ning of b@@ pa in babies &apos; bottles and si@@ ppy cups .
in addition to that , after the baby &apos;s born , our other unique invention as mammals is that we n@@ ouri@@ sh our off@@ spring after they &apos;re born .
th : one of this things that &apos;s exciting and appropriate for me to be here at ted@@ women is that , well , i think it was sum@@ med up best last night at dinner when someone said , &quot; turn to the man at your table and tell them , &apos; when the revolution starts , we &apos;ve got your back . &apos; &quot; the truth is , women , you &apos;ve had our back on this issue for a very long time , starting with rac@@ he@@ l car@@ son &apos;s &quot; silent spring &quot; to the@@ o col@@ born &apos;s &quot; our stolen future &quot; to sand@@ ra ste@@ in@@ grab@@ er &apos;s books &quot; living down@@ stream &quot; and &quot; having faith . &quot;
and it &apos;s my feeling and it &apos;s my ur@@ ging being here to know that , as we women move forward as the communi@@ ca@@ tors of this , but also as the ones who carry that burden of carrying the children , be@@ aring the children , we hold most of the buying power in the household , is that it &apos;s going to be us moving forward to carry the work of ty@@ r@@ one and other scientists around the world .
here is a remote island re@@ pos@@ itory for bottles off the coast of ba@@ ja california .
that day i ended up spending nearly 60 .
all the king &apos;s horses and all the king &apos;s men ...
but curi@@ ously , redwood rain@@ forests , the fra@@ gments that we have left , to this day remain under@@ -@@ explo@@ red .
and with a friend of his , he took it upon himself to fre@@ e-@@ climb a redwood without ro@@ pes or any equipment to see what was up there .
when steve sil@@ let@@ t gets up into a big redwood , he fires an ar@@ row , which tra@@ ils a fishing line , which gets over a branch in the tree , and then you as@@ c@@ end up a rope which has been dra@@ gged into the tree by the line .
this re@@ iter@@ ation is a huge flying but@@ tre@@ ss that comes out the tree itself .
they &apos;re finding out that red@@ woods can move mo@@ i@@ sture out of the air and down into their tr@@ un@@ ks , possibly all the way into their root systems .
what can the red@@ woods tell us about ourselves ?
richard pre@@ ston , thank you very much , i think .
the pc virus problem is 25 years old now .
and you can see at the top of the screen , there &apos;s a centi@@ pe@@ de sc@@ rolling across your computer when you get infected by this one .
well there &apos;s multiple different ways , such as banking tro@@ j@@ ans , which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking , or key@@ log@@ gers .
they also use the global nature of internet to their advantage .
and that &apos;s a back@@ door which will take over your computer .
now i &apos;m not a lawyer , but if i would be , this is where i would say , &quot; i rest my case . &quot;
so prepar@@ ed@@ ness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren &apos;t there .
there are lots of thing that the approach i take can predict , and there are some that it can &apos;t .
and many of you may have noticed that doesn &apos;t have as big an effect , as perhaps you would like it to have .
we &apos;ve increased it to 3.@@ 6 million .
you might notice what we don &apos;t need to know : there &apos;s no history in here .
and down at 100 they would build civi@@ lian nuclear energy , which is what they say is their objective .
everything is not predictable : the stock market is , at least for me , not predictable , but most complicated negoti@@ ations are predictable .
whether you &apos;re an artist , a technologi@@ st , a lawyer or a fan , the hand@@ ling of copyright directly impacts your life .
and then they benefit through the exposure , advertising and linked sales .
there &apos;s musical labe@@ ls .
if you saw these women on the street in their f@@ aded clothes , you might dis@@ miss them as poor and simple .
sat@@ aw@@ al is one half-@@ mile long by one mile wide .
this is part of our collective narrative .
it &apos;s the most important map of all .
you don &apos;t work in your self-interest all the time , because when emotion comes into it , the wi@@ ring changes in the way it functions .
so , i &apos;ve had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the question of the real question , which is what &apos;s the difference in somebody &apos;s life if you look at somebody like those people that you &apos;ve given everything to ? like all the resources they say they need . you gave them not a 10@@ 0-@@ dollar computer ; you gave them the best computer . you gave them love ; you gave them joy . you were there to comfort them .
the defining factor is never resources ; it &apos;s resour@@ ce@@ fulness .
honestly , better or worse ? say , &quot; ay@@ e . &quot;
your model of the world is the filter . that &apos;s what &apos;s sha@@ ping us .
how many of you here love surpri@@ ses ? say , &quot; ay@@ e . &quot;
if nothing else works for you , get a dog . don &apos;t get a cat . get a dog , because if you leave for two minutes , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve been gone for six months when you show back up again five minutes later , right ?
now , 18 years later , i &apos;m proud to tell you , last year we fed two million people in 35 countries through our foundation , all during the holi@@ days : thank@@ s@@ giving , christmas -- -- in all the different countries around the world .
she said , &quot; it &apos;s over . &quot; when i finished that night , she called him and left a message -- true story -- at the top of the world trade center where he worked , saying , &quot; honey , i love you , i just want you to know i want to marry you . it was stupid of me . &quot; she was as@@ le@@ ep , because it was 3 a.@@ m. for us , when he called her back from the top and said , &quot; honey , i can &apos;t tell you what this means . &quot;
and that was largely because there weren &apos;t any .
and we define ourselves by our gaps .
any dot can be cli@@ cked and expanded . and we see here , &quot; i would just feel so much better if i could cur@@ l up in his arms right now and feel his affe@@ ction for me in the embrace of his body and the ten@@ der@@ ness of his li@@ ps . &quot;
the next movement is called mo@@ bs .
here we see people that feel &quot; sli@@ pping , &quot; &quot; n@@ au@@ se@@ ous , &quot; &quot; responsible . &quot;
this is in response to , what &apos;s beautiful ? &quot; miss world . &quot;
it &apos;s called universe : reve@@ aling our modern mytho@@ logy .
we can click on one of those and have the photograph be the center of the universe .
here we have our star field . here we have our shapes .
but i think they &apos;re beautiful , don &apos;t you ?
what would that mean ? i have no idea .
this looks like a series of breaking waves , and it &apos;s caused by sh@@ ear@@ ing winds -- the wind above the cloud layer and below the cloud layer diff@@ er significantly , and in the middle , in between , you get this un@@ dul@@ ating of the air , and if the difference in those spee@@ ds is just right , the tops of the un@@ du@@ lations cur@@ l over in these beautiful breaking wa@@ ve-@@ like v@@ or@@ tic@@ es .
the sharp , cri@@ sp out@@ lines of this formation make it the best one for finding shapes in .
let &apos;s go back a few years in time and see what happened back then .
using computers , even though they &apos;re getting faster and better all the time , it &apos;s a challenge to deal with gi@@ g@@ aby@@ tes of data , ter@@ aby@@ tes of data and extrac@@ ting the relevant information .
you can see that there is &#91; a &#93; sca@@ tter@@ ing of x-@@ rays on the teeth , the metal in the teeth .
and again , it &apos;s fully interactive , so you can rotate and you can look at things in real time on these systems here .
it really just works like a huge iphone .
and to take that even further , this is a heart .
so mot@@ ts is doing something here , and probably he is going like this with his right hand , because the left side is activated on the motor cortex .
i can pe@@ el off the layer of the lion .
and so it was simply astonishing to me to find an organization that actually appreci@@ ated both those sides .
he said , &quot; ok . i measured the height of a bri@@ ck .
the standard explanation is that the universe somehow sp@@ ran@@ g into existence , full of a strange kind of energy -- inf@@ la@@ tionary energy -- which blew it up .
the density of matter is fin@@ ite , and we have a chance of a consistent set of equations that can describe the whole process .
and the next map now shows africa &apos;s gdp in 1960 , around the time of independence for many african states .
and to my astoni@@ shment , they bac@@ ked me 100 percent .
everyone lives together in this hotel -- lec@@ turers and students -- and it &apos;s not surprising at all to find an impro@@ mp@@ tu tu@@ tori@@ al at 1 a.@@ m .
i will be atten@@ ding aims .
i want to point out a few other ex@@ cep@@ tional people in this picture .
and our partners across africa are extremely enthusi@@ astic about this .
when computers were first introduced , they were said to be a million times faster than neurons .
and let me just summar@@ ize . so the bottom line : the brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have .
now , what &apos;s happening is that as transi@@ stors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller , they no longer behave like this .
ok , so a computer picks a specific item of data from memory , it sends it into the processor or the al@@ u , and then it puts the result back into memory .
this is k@@ are@@ em &apos;s dark eyes and that &apos;s the white background that you see here .
i was coming at it from a different perspective , where i was bringing that different perspective to bear on the problem .
so , despite the fact that i &apos;m going to talk to you about an object that &apos;s super@@ massive , and i &apos;m going to get to what that really means in a moment , it has no fin@@ ite size .
i need to understand the mass of the object i &apos;m cla@@ im@@ ing is a black hole , and what its sch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child radi@@ us is .
so , at the center there , that &apos;s actually where most of the star@@ light comes out from .
which is the job that i have to show you today .
you &apos;re seeing an animation that goes between an example of what you would see if you don &apos;t use this technique -- in other words , just a picture that shows the stars -- and the box is cen@@ tered on the center of the galaxy , where we think the black hole is .
and because of that , we &apos;ve been able to show that there is a super@@ massive black hole there .
in fact , we anticip@@ ated that star formation shouldn &apos;t proce@@ ed in that environment .
and i hope , if nothing else , i &apos;ve convinced you that , one , we do in fact have a super@@ massive black hole at the center of the galaxy .
and how people get this music , how it comes into their lives , really fascin@@ ates me .
but the way we react to different comb@@ inations of these phenomena is complex and emotional and not totally understood .
but every musician strikes a different balance between faith and reason , instin@@ ct and intelligence .
it &apos;s the time in which the big forms began to ari@@ se .
the culture in which we live now is a@@ wash with music of improvi@@ sation that &apos;s been sli@@ ced , di@@ ced , lay@@ ered and , god knows , distributed and sold .
and it exc@@ ites me now to meet people who are hi@@ kers , ch@@ efs , code writers , tax@@ i drivers , people i never would have guess@@ ed who loved the music and who are passing it on .
the real key observation he made is that a fre@@ e-@@ flying wing can swe@@ ep through more sky and generate more power in a unit of time than a fix@@ e@@ d-@@ wing tur@@ b@@ ine .
if you give me a 7@@ 47 , i &apos;ll make six mega@@ watts , which is more than the largest wind tur@@ b@@ ines today .
that comes from the last name of one of sch@@ u@@ mann &apos;s female friends .
and then you have to do the initial ske@@ tch of the character , which is like your structure of a piece , and then you add pen and pencil and whatever details that you need -- that &apos;s poli@@ shing the drawing .
now , she chose c , g , b , a , e .
it felt like a revolution .
it &apos;s based on hundreds of hours of research , of practice .
it &apos;s by giving away what you think is your deepest secret that maybe millions of people are empowered to help improve it .
but what &apos;s key here is , the reason these groups have been able to connect is because their work output is of the type that can be easily shared dig@@ it@@ ally -- a picture , a music file , software .
there &apos;s a problem with a traditional scientific paper .
it &apos;s right here .
schools can &apos;t be si@@ los .
the same trash site is feeding more than 30 families .
now , to make this more concrete , let &apos;s look at the list of top 10 words that statisti@@ cally stick out in the most favorite tedtalks and in the least favorite tedtalks .
and analysis shows if you want to be among the most favorite ted speakers , you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average , make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dre@@ s@@ se@@ d-@@ up than the average ted speaker .
so i &apos;m going to take as inspiration the fact that we &apos;re all interested in interacting with other people , i &apos;m going to completely strip it of all its compli@@ cating features , and i &apos;m going to turn that object , that simpli@@ fied object , into a scientific probe , and provide the early stages , embry@@ onic stages of new insights into what happens in two brains while they simultaneously interact .
drugs of abuse would come in , and they would change the way you value the world . they change the way you value the symbols associated with your drug of choice , and they make you value that over everything else .
and the short answer is games .
can@@ aries used to be used as kind of bio@@ sensors in mines .
read mon@@ ta@@ gue : what we &apos;re learning from 5,000 brains
politics and politicians will only succeed if they actually try and treat with people as they are , rather than as they would like them to be .
right now , here we are linked up to long beach and everywhere else , and all these secret locations for a fraction of that cost , and we can send and receive huge quanti@@ ties of information without it co@@ sting anything .
and you can see this looks a bit like a chef &apos;s hat , but actually that &apos;s an assa@@ ult , the one in blue .
obviously , here we have j@@ f@@ k with that incredibly simple and powerful for@@ mulation , &quot; ask not what your country can do for you ; ask what you can do for your country , &quot; an incredibly no@@ ble senti@@ ment .
how would i know who was the best ?
some teachers are far more effective than others .
you can &apos;t really dis@@ pu@@ te what you see on the video , and there is a lot to be learned from that , and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this .
that &apos;s underst@@ and@@ able , but our experience with met suggests that if teachers manage the process , if they collect video in their own classrooms , and they pick the lessons they want to sub@@ mit , a lot of them will be ea@@ ger to participate .
it &apos;s a movement that -- it ad@@ voca@@ tes making bi@@ otechnology accessible to everyone , not just scientists and people in government labs .
then we like to take things apart .
let me show you what you could do right now .
if everyone in this room got involved , who knows what we could do ?
but you know what ?
we &apos;re going to hear from two people who are on the sharp end of the law .
because i am hiv positive .
now drug use or pos@@ session is illegal in almost every country .
we can also train jud@@ ges so that they find flexi@@ bilities in the law and so that they rule on the side of tolerance rather than pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce .
that &apos;s where babies were born and people died .
the office building is basically ob@@ so@@ lete for doing private work .
this is even a more interesting solution in se@@ ou@@ l , korea .
we hope to have that built this fall .
we don &apos;t really believe in cameras to do things in homes .
and they are thought to be able to filter a cu@@ bic kilome@@ ter of water every hour and can feed on 30 ki@@ los of zo@@ o plan@@ k@@ ton a day to survive .
we &apos;re often all frighten@@ ed of sharks thanks to &quot; ja@@ ws . &quot;
it might be a change in the distribution of plan@@ k@@ ton .
i &apos;ll show you what they look like .
so very simple things like that , we &apos;re trying to learn about bas@@ king sharks .
but again , it &apos;s kind of surprising . you wouldn &apos;t really expect that .
that &apos;s ban@@ ned now , and that &apos;ll be good news for the sharks .
and they sat on it for months actually .
you probably saw the hu@@ mp@@ back whale footage that we got there a month or two ago off county w@@ ex@@ ford .
so thank you and thank you for listening .
they got themselves ready .
so with my hidden intention , i kept quiet .
but again , i can only affect society and affect government if i bring out the hard core evidence .
how did you end up in jail ? this was just a few weeks ago , i believe , yeah ?
does your breath smell bad while you &apos;re answer@@ ing my inter@@ ro@@ gation right now ?
i didn &apos;t want anyone to know that i was a girl , and they didn &apos;t .
i was just allowed to be me , growing and changing in every moment .
life magazine introduced generations of people to distant , far-@@ off cultures they never knew existed through pictures .
this is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation .
once they got over the shock , though , by and large people op@@ ted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent marks .
it &apos;s too late .
apparently , lu@@ ci@@ fer means &quot; the light . &quot;
all of them come from the cameras of american soldiers .
we look at what &apos;s inside of the person , the bad apples .
this is stan@@ ley mil@@ gram , little jewish kid from the bronx , and he asked the question , &quot; could the ho@@ lo@@ cau@@ st happen here , now ? &quot;
you &apos;re a good person . you compla@@ in .
most of the time , we are in institutions , so the stanford prison study is a study of the power of institutions to influence individual behavior .
they &apos;re going to become numbers .
mind@@ lessly taking the first small step .
bul@@ lying is a disease . pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce is a disease . violence is a disease .
she came down , saw that mad@@ house and said , &quot; you know what , it &apos;s terrible what you &apos;re doing to those boys .
w@@ es@@ ley and the guy -- 20 and a half inches height .
we would have no access to love or to the ability to create .
and of course consider images that can be sensory patterns , visual , such as you &apos;re having right now in relation to the stage and me , or aud@@ itory images , as you are having now in relation to my words .
very odd -- i &apos;ve analy@@ zed this for a while .
and i thought about a solution to this problem .
you have , in effect , lost consciousness when you have damage to that red section of the brain stem .
except that they &apos;re not as rich as ours , because they don &apos;t have a cere@@ br@@ al cortex like we do .
we should look at how society and culture in this soci@@ o-@@ cultural regu@@ lation are a work in progress .
my dad actually re@@ signed from the mal@@ e-@@ only business club in my hometown because he said he would never be part of an organization that would one day welcome his son , but not his daughter .
i say , &quot; online organizing . &quot;
x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia &apos;s on the rise . the tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king of women and girls .
many of them are working in deeply in@@ trac@@ table systems -- the military , congress , the education system , etc .
the ma@@ xi@@ m , &quot; know th@@ y@@ self &quot; has been around since the ancient gree@@ ks .
this is the term that ar@@ mies use when they &apos;ve lost a battle .
i may also be interested in knowing how focused i am , so i can put my level of attention into the circuit board on the other side .
we created the respon@@ sive room where the lights music and blin@@ ds adju@@ sted to your state .
normally we think about technology as interactive .
with human@@ ized technology we can monitor the quality of your sleep cycles .
ari@@ el gar@@ ten : know th@@ y@@ self , with a brain scanner
so let me just tell you , the great part of all of this ?
and with the same do@@ gged determin@@ ation that my father had b@@ red into me since i was such a child -- he taught me how to sa@@ il , knowing i could never see where i was going , i could never see the shore , and i couldn &apos;t see the sa@@ ils , and i couldn &apos;t see the destination .
and you all know what it is . you don &apos;t need to have a disability to know that .
and he said , &quot; do you love it ? &quot;
and i didn &apos;t know what to do .
nobody &apos;s ever done it before , so i &apos;m going to go do it .
and i set up kan@@ ch@@ i , because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant , because disability is like the elephant in the room .
and stop with the labe@@ ls , the lim@@ iting .
the reason , i think , is that the pen@@ sion@@ ers believe they &apos;ve chosen to be pen@@ sion@@ ers , whereas the young unemp@@ loyed feel it &apos;s been th@@ ru@@ st upon them .
do you call it the ba@@ il@@ out of gree@@ ce or the ba@@ il@@ out of a load of stupid banks which l@@ ent to gree@@ ce ?
and i think that &apos;s probably right .
everybody else at the time of google , more or less , was trying to be a port@@ al .
if you &apos;re on the way to visit your mother in-@@ law , you &apos;d probably prefer to stay on the left .
there &apos;s the real value , which is when you make something in a factory and provide a service , and then there &apos;s a kind of du@@ bi@@ ous value , which you create by changing the way people look at things .
i would argue , in britain there &apos;s a much better frame of reference , which is to tell people that more first-@@ class mail arri@@ ves the next day in the u.k. than in germany .
and within that context , we can offer the kids time -- something that seems in short supply in their over-@@ sche@@ dul@@ ed lives .
hi . so , this cha@@ p here , he thinks he can tell you the future .
these drugs were brought to market . they were prescri@@ bed very widely because heart attacks are a very common thing , and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs also caused an increased rate of death that before we dete@@ cted that safety signal , over 100,000 people died un@@ necessarily in america from the prescription of anti-@@ ar@@ rhyth@@ mic drugs .
only three of the negative trials were published , but all but one of the positive trials were published .
and the most st@@ agger@@ ing thing of all of this , to me , is that not only is this a problem , not only do we recognize that this is a problem , but we &apos;ve had to suffer fake fi@@ xes .
nasa supported this work 12 years ago as part of the re@@ building of the ha@@ y@@ den plan@@ et@@ arium so that we would share this with the world .
we have a growing user base of this , and we network dom@@ es .
so , with the mit media lab , for quite a while now , we &apos;ve been engaged in a field called active music .
so we know , for instance , that music is almost always the last thing that people with advanced alzheimer &apos;s can still respond to .
the main singer disappears at the beginning of the opera and the entire stage becomes the main character . it becomes his legacy .
so , first of all , dan , do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are ?
do they provide structure for us to do that ? and , you know , that &apos;s a personal relationship to expression that is l@@ acking in the technological sphere . so , you know , with dan , we needed a new design process , a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform .
do you remember the story of o@@ dys@@ se@@ us and the si@@ ren@@ s from high school or j@@ uni@@ or high school ?
if you do that tomorrow , i &apos;ll be dead , you &apos;ll be dead , every single one of the men will be dead .
it has these strong , hero@@ ic arms that can lift dou@@ gh@@ nuts into your mouth .
on average , it was just a completely poin@@ tless exchange of money that i would regret .
we look at the savings rate and it has been declin@@ ing since the 1950s .
yes , this person reti@@ red at 150 percent of their working income in retirement .
and from the future self &apos;s point of view , everything is in reverse .
and just for kic@@ ks we ran his picture through the bal@@ ding , aging and weight gain software to see how he would look .
also , those very sounds tend not to be represented by the characters that are available in european languages .
even in the be@@ st-@@ resour@@ ced countries in the world , this life expectancy gap is as much as 20 years .
in z@@ im@@ bab@@ we , for example , there were just about a dozen psychiat@@ rists , most of whom lived and worked in har@@ are city , leaving only a couple to address the mental health care needs of nine million people living in the coun@@ try@@ side .
for me , what &apos;s truly sun@@ dar about the idea of task shifting , though , isn &apos;t that it simply makes health care more accessible and affordable but that it is also fundamentally empower@@ ing .
we began the project with an inter@@ im report , which quickly pulled together a lot of information that had been collected on the subject by many , many researchers .
but when did a bee actually ever give you an inv@@ o@@ ice ?
now i &apos;m going to show you how business as usual will affect this .
if you drill water to make coke near a village farm , that &apos;s not illegal , but yes , it costs the community .
and the chinese government responded sensi@@ bly and placed a ban on fel@@ ling .
it &apos;s about energy emissions .
we &apos;ve actually kind of made an ethical choice in society to not have coral reefs .
but the man had somehow a lot of room at the bottom .
feynman loved this story .
but it was really bru@@ tal .
we were up in the mountains , 197@@ 6 .
but he was very excited that he had finally met somebody who had the same experience with my father as he had with his father .
he would try to visualize it , gui@@ ded by a small number of simple principles .
if you could do all of them , you would have a very precise theory .
how should we really honor feynman ?
it &apos;s a com@@ pound curve interior .
so the problem became -- and they set this dilemma to me -- that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology , and there &apos;s no money for to@@ oling or mol@@ ding .
and despite all of our best efforts and inten@@ tions , kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous thing they can , in whatever environment they can .
i first saw this in a canadian film board film when i was 10 , and it left a la@@ sting impression , to see babies playing with kni@@ ves .
it &apos;s a very simple exercise -- buy a song on it@@ un@@ es , write it to a c@@ d , then ri@@ p the c@@ d to an mp@@ 3 and play it on your very same computer .
so this motivated me to become an ortho@@ pe@@ dic surgeon and to see if i couldn &apos;t focus on solutions for those problems that would keep me playing sports and not limit me .
well the reason is because there &apos;s not enough donor cycles .
so that &apos;s our bio@@ logic approach right now .
and it wouldn &apos;t be fun to talk about the space age without seeing a flag that was carried to the moon and back , on apol@@ lo 11 .
more tomorrow . i also have pictures coming of the library for those of you that have asked for pictures .
so hopefully tomorrow i &apos;ll show one or two more objects from the stage , but for today i just wanted to say thank you for all the people that came and talked to us about it .
but i brought along here a lu@@ mp of coal -- right here , one lu@@ mp of coal .
when edi@@ son invented the light bulb , pretty much looked like this .
but they want to use it -- seriously .
we &apos;re also working on noise can@@ cel@@ ing things like s@@ nor@@ ing , noise from autom@@ ob@@ iles .
i said we can shor@@ ten the column , we can spread it out to cover the cou@@ ch .
i have a bunch of other inventions .
getting it over there ?
so i exist somewhat outside of the mainstream of design thinking .
to this end , i have worked in sugar for ste@@ fan sa@@ g@@ me@@ i@@ ster , three-@@ time ted speaker .
for some reason , i thought it would be a good idea to put an inter@@ mission in my talk .
&quot; you &apos;ve never really been sure of this , but i can as@@ sure you that this quir@@ k you &apos;re so self-@@ conscious of is inten@@ sely en@@ de@@ aring .
and it &apos;s very , very common for designers and people in the visual arts to feel that we &apos;re not contribu@@ ting enough , or worse , that all we &apos;re doing is contribu@@ ting to land@@ fill .
re@@ zero keeps his balance by constantly measuring his pitch angle with a sensor .
with a screen it could in@@ form people or show them around in a fun and enter@@ taining way .
and so , going back to this ab@@ alone shell , besides being nan@@ o-@@ struc@@ tured , one thing that &apos;s fascinating , is when a male and a female ab@@ alone get together , they pass on the genetic information that says , &quot; this is how to build an ex@@ quis@@ ite material .
the ab@@ alone shell here -- and if you frac@@ ture it , you can look at the fact that it &apos;s nan@@ o-@@ struc@@ tured .
it took them about 50 million years to learn how to perfect how to make that ab@@ alone shell .
i brought it here .
angel@@ a bel@@ cher : using nature to grow batteries
and then you &apos;ll hear things like the train , a plane , a car -- so , the commu@@ te .
and what you find is that , especially with creative people -- designers , programmers , writers , engineers , thin@@ kers -- that people really need long stret@@ ches of un@@ interrup@@ ted time to get something done .
why do we expect people to work well if they &apos;re being interrup@@ ted all day at the office ?
that &apos;s kind of ridiculous . it &apos;s a total de@@ co@@ y .
i mean , what are the chances that all 10 people are ready to stop ?
because the offices are well equi@@ pped , everything should be there for them to do their work , but they don &apos;t want to go there right now , so how do we change that ?
you can quit i.@@ m. ; you can &apos;t hide your man@@ ager .
this is my office . it &apos;s out there .
i mean , i couldn &apos;t take your phones off you if i wanted to .
i think , quite a nice feature .
so , we &apos;ve been conduc@@ ting a lot of research .
it brings ru@@ di@@ mentary banking services to places where there &apos;s no banking infrastructure .
like , this is vi@@ ag@@ ra that i bought from a back@@ street sex shop in china .
for me , this kind of person@@ i@@ fies this connected world , where everything is inter@@ tw@@ ined , and the dots are -- it &apos;s all about the dots jo@@ ining together .
and , with that , comes the third point , which is ob@@ lig@@ ation -- and an ob@@ lig@@ ation to that avail@@ ability .
our reality right now is less interesting than the story we &apos;re going to tell about it later .
what were we just talking about ?
dean or@@ n@@ ish shares new research that shows how adop@@ ting healthy lifestyle habits can affect a person at a genetic level . for instance , he says , when you live healthier , eat better , exercise , and love more , your brain cells actually increase .
this idea is nic@@ ely captured by this quote : &quot; things without all reme@@ dy should be without regard ; what &apos;s done is done . &quot;
these are the classic conditions that create regret .
but it turns out that regret feels awful in four very specific and consistent ways .
make it go away . make it go away . &quot;
because of course , sometimes we do make decisions that have ir@@ re@@ vo@@ cable and terrible consequences , either for our own or for other people &apos;s health and happiness and live@@ li@@ hoods , and in the very worst case scenario , even their lives .
when other people see my tat@@ too , for the most part they like how it looks .
thank you .
half of them gave over the internet .
and pretty soon , the average price was 19@@ 2 dollars .
today these low prices are available in the 25 countries where we work , and in a total of 6@@ 2 countries , and about 5@@ 50,000 people are getting the benefits of them .
recently we did an evalu@@ ation of the first 18 months of our efforts in rwanda .
that &apos;s about 4@@ 3 percent of all the pregn@@ anci@@ es .
i am grateful for this prize , and i will use it to that end .
the classrooms have no walls .
but an amazing alternative energy company in paris is taking us off the grid with solar .
this was a great thing .
this young man is picking organic vegetables .
and together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global , green leaders .
is this do@@ able in your community ?
cha@@ z e@@ bert : it was cha@@ z who stood by my side through three attemp@@ ts to re@@ construct my ja@@ w and restore my ability to speak .
then i tried ty@@ ping words on my laptop and using its built in voice .
they &apos;d never made one from previ@@ ous@@ ly-@@ recorded materials .
people who need a voice should know that most computers already come with buil@@ t-@@ in speaking systems .
the initi@@ als stood for programmed logic for autom@@ ated teaching operations .
now we live in the age of the internet , which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness .
sometimes they assume i am deaf .
a guy goes into a psychiat@@ rist .
so what can we do ?
other examples you can see here are from lat@@ via , li@@ thu@@ an@@ ia , est@@ on@@ ia -- the central european countries .
so first you ask a big question : why we do it ? what is the goal ?
you will recall that in 197@@ 6 , june 16 , the students of south africa boy@@ cot@@ ted the language of afri@@ ka@@ ans as the medium of the op@@ press@@ or , as they were sort of like really told that they must do everything in afri@@ ka@@ ans -- biology , mathematics -- and what about our languages ?
she ended up underneath the car .
and i ended up with a plastic nose , por@@ cel@@ ain teeth and all kinds of other things .
so they eventually started mat@@ ching their talents and skills to all of my needs .
so i moved on from there .
and as a blind person , your visual memory f@@ ades and is replaced with how you feel about things and how things sound and how things smell .
and he wrote to the acade@@ mic@@ ians in paris , trying to explain his theory .
and i think g@@ ali@@ leo sum@@ med up , very nic@@ ely , the power of mathematics to understand the scientific world around us .
but i wanted to try and en@@ rich him .
so i &apos;m going to take you through , perhaps push you a little bit mathema@@ tically -- so br@@ ace yourselves -- push you a little bit to understand how this language works , which enables us to capture what is symmetry .
so both of these objects have six symmetries .
let &apos;s do a ro@@ tation by a third of a turn an@@ tic@@ lo@@ ck@@ wise , and reflect in the line through x .
but the shapes match up if i rotate by a sixth of a turn around the point where all the tri@@ angles meet .
well , unfortunately it isn &apos;t really a picture . if i could have my board at the side here , great , excellent .
two ? so you should have sat down earlier .
i &apos;ve learned that they &apos;re really the essence of what makes for progress , even when they seem to be terrible .
but i think from the point of view of a neander@@ thal , there would have been a lot of disap@@ pro@@ val of the w@@ imp@@ ish ch@@ op@@ pers that we now have .
and mark tw@@ ain , who knew all about ty@@ pe@@ setting , really was sm@@ it@@ ten by this machine .
and my favorite example of that occurred beginning in 197@@ 6 , when it was discovered that the bacteria causing legi@@ on@@ nai@@ res disease had always been present in natural waters , but it was the precise temperature of the water in heating , venti@@ l@@ ating and air condi@@ tioning systems that raised the right temperature for the maximum re@@ production of legi@@ on@@ el@@ la bac@@ ill@@ us .
think of the financial world , for example .
for some reason , there &apos;s no standard syl@@ lab@@ us , there &apos;s no basic course .
here &apos;s something that drives me crazy .
you get it every time .
and instead of that point and click , it &apos;s like a push and pull , things colli@@ de as you &apos;d expect them . just like on my real desk , i can -- let me just grab these guys -- i can turn things into pil@@ es instead of just the fol@@ ders that we have .
i think you can really en@@ rich the way we brow@@ se our photographs and bring it to that kind of sho@@ e@@ box of , you know , photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing .
let me introduce you to my brand new project , &quot; bar@@ o@@ que in rock , &quot; which became a golden dis@@ c most recently .
they acquire the sen@@ sibility of truth because they repeat over and over again , and they o@@ ssi@@ fy and cal@@ ci@@ fy , and they become real .
and i said , &quot; what &apos;s the black box for wall street ? &quot;
and the ga@@ g is that , of course , these aren &apos;t just running through the market .
and the thing is , is that this isn &apos;t google .
we &apos;re designing for this machine di@@ ale@@ ct .
it involves light con@@ es and quantum ent@@ ang@@ lement , and i don &apos;t really understand any of that .
this much , right ?
j@@ s : cuts itself .
fif@@ ty percent of cra@@ shes happen at inter@@ sections .
add that together with the gas , and it &apos;s $ 11@@ 2,000 per year , just for that sign in each direction .
when people come to an un@@ familiar situation they don &apos;t know how to deal with they slow down .
for example , meas@@ les was four million of the deaths back as recently as 1990 and now is under 4@@ 00,000 .
and more recently you can see it &apos;s just around the equ@@ ator .
and that &apos;s where we saw the malaria map sh@@ rin@@ king .
i can say that , even though i &apos;m a college dro@@ p-@@ out .
so , how do you make education better ?
you might think these are people with master &apos;s degrees .
and the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public schools .
and that allows us to understand who &apos;s doing it well , and call them out , and find out what those techniques are .
you know , the system doesn &apos;t naturally make it happen .
the first embrace is something that we think , &quot; oh , this is very easy , &quot; but it &apos;s actually getting harder , and that &apos;s paying attention to the world around us .
i was to the point where i was using a stop@@ watch and painting squares out of random@@ ness , and i wasn &apos;t getting anywhere . so i went back and du@@ mped all my paintings in the ar@@ no , and i thought , i &apos;m going to just start playing around .
i &apos;ll find a way to get in , because i don &apos;t want to see this history disappear . &quot;
how many of you are completely comfortable with calling yourselves a leader ?
&quot; and i felt so bad for this du@@ de that i took the lo@@ lli@@ pop , and as soon as i did , you got this incredibly severe look on your face and you looked at my mom and my dad , and you said , &apos; look at that . look at that .
we need to get over it so we can move beyond it , and our little brothers and our little sisters , and one day our kids -- or our kids right now -- can watch and start to value the impact we can have on each other &apos;s lives more than money and power and ti@@ tles and influence .
so nowadays in the operating room , we no longer need to use sunlight .
so if you &apos;ve sent three speci@@ men@@ s , it &apos;s an hour later .
the molecule passes through and gets ex@@ cre@@ ted .
and then if that no@@ de has cancer , the woman would go on to get the ax@@ il@@ lary ly@@ mph no@@ de dis@@ section .
in the setting of prostate cancer , up to 60 percent of men after prostate cancer surgery may have ur@@ inary in@@ contin@@ ence and er@@ ec@@ tile dis@@ function .
so here &apos;s a tumor .
i &apos;d like to leave you with this final thought .
and this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about .
but electricity also will go in all directions -- the path of least resistance , which is where that phrase , in part , comes from .
and because it &apos;s a protein , it &apos;s en@@ co@@ ded for in the dna of this organism .
so if we could figure out what cells they are , we could maybe find new targets for which drugs could be designed or scre@@ ened against , or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability .
and the animal &apos;s going to hear a tone -- and a flash of light occurred there .
maybe 100,000 people have coch@@ lear im@@ plants , which allow them to hear .
and the goal , of course , of this ma@@ ze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that &apos;s under the lit top port .
and by turning things off , it &apos;s more or less a zero .
and we also sam@@ pled the out@@ door air .
thank you .
there were no cars , so it seemed even better , in some ways .
so it &apos;s been a very optimistic time , i think , and i want to just talk about a few of those things .
this is what they think about my site ; it &apos;s ran@@ ked by blog authority .
so basically , the number of pages that mention this term , that also mention this page , the percentage of those pages is that person &apos;s google share of that term .
they &apos;re talking about slavery in 18@@ 60 .
if you &apos;re the second site there , most people link to you .
we are increasingly offered a diet in which sensation , not story , is king .
and the speed with which they associate it with &quot; slu@@ m@@ dog milli@@ on@@ ai@@ re &quot; or the fav@@ el@@ as in rio speaks to the en@@ during nature .
and the stories they held provided a shared experience .
these films held what was too hur@@ t@@ ful to say out loud , and they became more useful to me than the whis@@ pers of survi@@ vors and the occa@@ sional glimpse of a tat@@ too on a ma@@ id@@ en a@@ unt &apos;s wrist .
can opera be ever@@ -@@ so-@@ slightly sexy ? the glorious sop@@ ran@@ o dan@@ i@@ el@@ le de ni@@ ese shows how , singing the fli@@ r@@ ty &quot; me@@ ine li@@ pp@@ en , si@@ e k@@ ü@@ ss@@ en so he@@ i@@ ss . &quot; which , translated , means , as you might guess : &quot; i ki@@ ss so hot . &quot; from gi@@ u@@ d@@ it@@ ta by fr@@ ans le@@ h@@ á@@ r ; accompan@@ ist : ing@@ rid sur@@ gen@@ or .
commer@@ ce , on the other hand , is relatively quick , essentially creative , highly effective and efficient , and fundamentally honest , because we can &apos;t exchange value for very long if we don &apos;t trust each other .
so we &apos;ve designed products and we analy@@ zed chemicals down to the parts per million .
the upper is n@@ yl@@ on 6 that can go back to ca@@ pro@@ l@@ ac@@ ta@@ m , the bottom , a pol@@ yo@@ le@@ ph@@ ine -- infin@@ itely re@@ cy@@ cl@@ able ther@@ m@@ op@@ la@@ stic .
when asked , they said , &quot; it &apos;s kind of like a giant toilet that doesn &apos;t fl@@ ush . &quot;
and we have plenty of energy , so we &apos;ll solve that problem , but the biology problem &apos;s tri@@ cky , because as we put through all these toxic materials that we dis@@ gor@@ ge , we will never be able to recover that .
shoes for ni@@ ke , where the up@@ pers are poly@@ est@@ ers , infin@@ itely re@@ cy@@ cl@@ able , the bottom@@ s are bio@@ degra@@ dable sol@@ es .
because if they to@@ xi@@ fy themselves , being the lo@@ we@@ st-@@ cost produc@@ er , send it to the lo@@ we@@ st-@@ cost distribution -- wal@@ -@@ mart -- and then we send them all our money , what we &apos;ll discover is that we have what , effectively , when i was a student , was called mu@@ tually assu@@ red destruction .
and then the com@@ post is all taken back to the roofs of the city , where we &apos;ve got farming , because what we &apos;ve done is lifted up the city , the landscape , into the air to -- to restore the native landscape on the roofs of the buildings .
this is five times larger .
we didn &apos;t know about x@@ key@@ score . we didn &apos;t know about cyber@@ tr@@ ans .
yet we have these files .
all right , how many swe@@ dish decision@@ makers and politicians and business leaders use , every day , u.@@ s@@ .@@ -based services , like , you know , run windows or os@@ x , or use facebook or lin@@ ke@@ d@@ in , or store their data in clouds like ic@@ loud or sky@@ drive or dro@@ p@@ box , or maybe use online services like amazon web services or sales support ?
and whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasn &apos;t thought about this long enough .
she was one of the targets of n@@ sa surveillance .
humans have long held a fas@@ c@@ ination for the human brain .
and what you can see is it &apos;s very non-@@ uni@@ form . you see a lot more structure there .
we get one from mom , one from dad .
and in seattle , we take these -- this is a whole human hemisphere -- and we put them into what &apos;s basically a glori@@ fied meat sli@@ cer .
you can see on the microscope slide here , that &apos;s what &apos;s happening in real time .
green is the sort of cool areas where it &apos;s not turned on .
so if you &apos;re in drug discovery , for example , you can go through an entire li@@ sting of what the genome has on offer to find perhaps better drug targets and optimi@@ ze .
these aren &apos;t schizophren@@ ic individuals , but they do show some population variation .
so why is that ?
the thing is , if we don &apos;t know whether we are doing any good , we are not any better than the medi@@ eval doctors and their le@@ e@@ ches .
&quot; if you give the nets for free , people are not going to value them .
that &apos;s bad , but there are places like that .
and then you make it easy and give a reason to act now by adding a kil@@ o of l@@ enti@@ ls for each immun@@ ization .
the third one is important because if we think people get used to hand@@ outs , it might destroy markets to distribu@@ te free bed nets .
you know how to immun@@ ize kids , you know how to give bed nets . &quot;
tell people the benefits of education , that &apos;s very cheap to do .
but look what we just did today .
and now , maybe , we can go back to the bigger question that i started with at the beginning .
we &apos;ve all heard these things .
and that has to do with me because in 1994 , i packed a few things into a back@@ pack and headed off for a year of travel in the middle of my university career .
so let &apos;s start sh@@ ed@@ ding light on this amazing ec@@ lec@@ tic continent that has so much to offer .
so the very definition -- to say &quot; invest in africa &quot; is a no-@@ go .
but looking at gold@@ man s@@ ach@@ s &apos; work -- we had the famous bri@@ c report .
the announ@@ cement just came out the last few weeks .
it &apos;s more expensive to transport goods . prices of goods go up , inf@@ lation is affected .
it &apos;s the 24@@ -@@ hour rolling african news channel .
it also provides a third of the food we eat .
we so rarely look at the sky .
so this is the footage that i was showing everybody .
okay .
so this is the footage he photographed , and it was pretty moving and pretty awe@@ -@@ inspiring .
it was , inci@@ dentally , the last time i ever saw day@@ light .
and he said , &quot; because no one knows you had anything to do with it . &quot;
how could somebody read using their finger@@ tips ?
k@@ t : no .
kb : just don &apos;t break my concentration .
i need two people to help me out real quick .
ok , now , do you believe in wit@@ ch@@ craft at all ?
kb : what did you feel ?
ok , now , allow it to stay there .
and hold it there , hold it there , both of you , hold it there .
come right over here , next to me .
and i want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side .
you knew !
they &apos;ll keep an eye on me to make sure i don &apos;t do anything funny .
s@@ j : you &apos;re over a cup .
do you think the spi@@ ke is under your left hand , or under your right hand ?
that &apos;s not good . hi . yeah . real bad . don &apos;t even look at me .
you know that when you have those ab@@ u@@ sive voices , all those little neurons get together and in that little gap you get a real toxic &quot; i want to kill myself &quot; kind of chemical , and if you have that over and over again on a loop tape , you might have yourself depression .
we are not equi@@ pped for the 21st century .
we need to know why people are doing what they &apos;re doing .
but it was te@@ st@@ ably stupid .
and in that pair , one person gets a message saying , &quot; do you want to give up some of your $ 10 you ear@@ ned for being here and ship it to someone else in the lab ? &quot;
so to make the experiment , i knew i &apos;d have to go into the brain and manipulate oxytocin directly .
so if i do something that hur@@ ts you , i feel that pain .
tell that guy to wait half an hour .
now there are other ways the system can be inhi@@ bited .
the bri@@ de .
so there &apos;s tons of ways that we can connect to other people , and it seems to be universal .
i tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools , where did it come from ?
and you have people who guide those computers to do their cl@@ eri@@ cal jobs .
one of your students must have been passing by , showed them how to use the mouse . &quot;
there &apos;s one community of children in southern india whose english p@@ ron@@ un@@ ci@@ ation is really bad , and they needed good p@@ ron@@ un@@ ci@@ ation because that would improve their jobs .
i came back after two months and the children tro@@ op@@ ed in and said , &quot; we &apos;ve understood nothing . &quot;
k@@ alli@@ ku@@ pp@@ am had caught up with my control school in new delhi , a rich private school with a trained bi@@ otechnology teacher .
the re@@ p@@ ti@@ lian part of our brain , which sits in the center of our brain , when it &apos;s threatened , it shu@@ ts down everything else , it shu@@ ts down the pre@@ frontal cortex , the parts which learn , it shu@@ ts all of that down .
you can &apos;t catch me .
you already heard about that . you know what that means .
it &apos;s a facility which is prac@@ tically un@@ man@@ ned .
i &apos;ll play at these rock shows , be on stage standing completely still , and they &apos;re like , &quot; what &apos;s she doing ? ! what &apos;s she doing ? ! &quot;
if i pass out on the next song ...
this qu@@ and@@ ary led to the title of the project , which consi@@ ders in many ways that we are all the living dead and that we in some ways represent gho@@ sts of the past and the future .
and i found these maps which you see here .
so they &apos;re testing its vir@@ ul@@ ence .
everyone showed up .
ten@@ sions between these two families date back to 19@@ 13 when there was a dis@@ pu@@ te over local political power .
this is just an ab@@ ri@@ dged ren@@ dering of over a thousand images .
there &apos;s nothing too difficult about the piece .
and you feel really quite -- believe it or not -- de@@ t@@ ached from the instrument and from the stick , even though i &apos;m actually holding the stick quite ti@@ ghtly .
they &apos;re all different .
exactly . because i &apos;m not even touching it .
in a year &apos;s time , it could be two extra steps .
however , not one of you got out of your seats to think , &quot; right ! how can i cla@@ p ? ok , maybe ...
and interestingly , the older i became , and when i became a full-@@ time student at a so called &quot; music institution , &quot; all of that went out of the window .
in this so@@ aring demonstration , deaf per@@ cus@@ sion@@ ist ev@@ el@@ y@@ n gl@@ en@@ ni@@ e illustr@@ ates how listening to music involves much more than simply letting sound waves hit your ear@@ dru@@ ms .
and it got big enough to the point where there was a flo@@ at last year at the m@@ acy &apos;s thank@@ s@@ giving day para@@ de , and ri@@ ck ast@@ ley po@@ ps out , and ri@@ ck@@ ro@@ lls millions of people on television .
but that &apos;s not what &apos;s interesting about this .
got a couple questions for you .
but there were some good things that came out of that too .
and they were probably ple@@ ased to see you on top of the time po@@ ll .
dinosaur evolution proce@@ eded at a st@@ ately pace , an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it .
a three-@@ and-@@ a-half foot thing , beautiful skull , predator , me@@ at@@ -@@ e@@ ater , a two-@@ leg@@ ged animal .
your job as a leader -- this is definitely a team sport -- your job as a leader is to try to inspire them to do more work than they &apos;ve ever done in their life under conditions that they can &apos;t imagine .
it turns out to have a fore@@ brain one-@@ fif@@ teen@@ th the size of a human .
somebody get the front legs .
and then work later is going to take us to ti@@ bet .
now we have diver@@ gence over time , but we &apos;ve created the third dimension of area .
they &apos;re really kin@@ dre@@ d discipl@@ ines .
you have to have those steps . if you have -- it &apos;s easy to get kids interested in science .
you give her a quick crack in the teeth with your el@@ bow and bla@@ ze for the finish line .
they &apos;re not doing 26 miles ; they &apos;re doing 100 , 150 miles at a time , and apparently without injury , without problems .
there &apos;s not a fast woman on the planet and there never has been .
so about seven years , eight years to reach your peak , and then gradually you fall off your peak , until you go back to the starting point .
you need a pack to pull together .
and what happened was we started creating these fancy cu@@ shi@@ oned things , which can make running &quot; better , &quot; called running shoes .
but maybe there &apos;s another benefit there as well .
for me , that was the white space ; that &apos;s what robots could not do yet .
he &apos;s a scary mon@@ ster .
you call your friend , she puts her hand@@ set in a robot , and , b@@ am ! you &apos;re a me@@ bo@@ t -- you can make eye contact , you can talk with your friends , you can move around , you can gesture -- maybe the next best thing to really being there , or is it ?
i imagine a time not too far from now -- my mom can go to her computer , open up a brow@@ ser and jack into a little robot .
to explore that question , we did a study in the boston area where we put one of three interventions in people &apos;s homes for a period of several weeks .
but we can push this idea further .
robots touch something deeply human within us .
and i can &apos;t have my pos@@ se laugh@@ in &apos; at me .
and i followed this guy everywhere until i had him in the room , and i read him one of my pieces , and you know what he told me ?
i can master shock of &quot; the crying game &quot; with the a@@ we of a child being called an aids victim by a bul@@ ly who didn &apos;t know that it was his father who gave it to my mother , and that &apos;s a double ent@@ end@@ re .
i then went on wondering whether i could actually replace her image , so i got a loo@@ k-@@ alike of di@@ ana and posed her in the right positions and angles and created something that was in , or existed in , the public imagination .
well , here is the image .
so , all this work is getting shown in art gall@@ eries .
this image is quite interesting , actually , because i think we made it three years ago .
what jack ni@@ chol@@ son might be up to in his celebrity life , and the fact that he tried to ... he had a bit of road rage and gol@@ f-@@ clu@@ b@@ bed a driver the other day .
has anyone here wondered what will happen if you go back to your room at night , and you start getting chest pa@@ ins , shor@@ t@@ ness of breath , swe@@ ating ?
that is something to keep in mind . we can &apos;t deal with it with situations like this .
we have 25 positions right now -- all of them trained , board certi@@ fied in the usa , canada or britain .
and we will do other centers .
they need to be alive , they need to feed .
we &apos;re also starting an@@ c@@ il@@ lary health@@ -@@ care technology training programs -- training people in e@@ cho@@ cardi@@ o@@ graphy , car@@ dia@@ c ultrasound , those kinds of things . now , with that kind of training , it gives people motivation .
and i actually feel at home here , because there &apos;s a lot of autism genetics here .
my drawings got to star in the movie too .
and the way i sold livestock jobs is i showed off my drawings , i showed off pictures of things .
i was really concerned about having to wear this gad@@ get on my face .
i find a lot of people have difficulty doing that .
he was now dr. car@@ lock in the movie .
and when i was 13 , i had a job at a dre@@ ss@@ maker &apos;s shop se@@ wing clothes .
because what i &apos;m obser@@ ving is the good teachers , for a lot of these kids , are out in the community colle@@ ges , but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools .
what are you most passionate about ?
now my own speci@@ ality is comb@@ ining digital technology and magic .
by@@ e-@@ bye .
and it was deep . it was deep in my soul .
now there &apos;s a talent un@@ to itself .
and now the shore is coming , and there &apos;s just a little part of me that &apos;s sad .
thank you .
the first problem is there &apos;s in@@ adequ@@ ate disaster response .
they send him to iraq .
i think it &apos;s very important , because right now somebody needs to step up , and this generation of veter@@ ans has the opportunity to do that if they are given the chance .
what would this lead to ?
and so they invented the scientific journal as a way of synchron@@ izing the argument across the community of natural scientists .
the programmers come and go .
this has the following effect : a program@@ mer in e@@ din@@ burgh and a program@@ mer in en@@ te@@ b@@ be can both get the same -- a copy of the same piece of software .
right .
it was the expec@@ tation of the citizens that she would not be cen@@ so@@ red .
this one i thought i &apos;d show you .
mor@@ gan h@@ end@@ ry : be@@ ware of safety is an instru@@ mental rock band .
so we literally are all made out of star@@ dust .
and if you look at the top left , you see a little teen@@ y dark dot .
okay , we have parachute alig@@ ned .
bc : we enter the mar@@ tian atmosphere .
that &apos;s when we separate from the back shell , and we &apos;re now in fre@@ e-@@ fall .
then we get a little bit more serious , so we have what we call our ca@@ d / ca@@ ms and all the engineers who are involved , or scientists who are involved , who know about thermal properties , know about design , know about atmo@@ spher@@ ic interaction , parachu@@ tes , all of these things , which they work in a team effort and actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent , so to see , does that meet the requi@@ rement that we need .
but also , if there is something that we cannot reach because it is too high on a cliff , we have a little laser system which will actually z@@ ap the rock , eva@@ por@@ ate some of it , and actually analyze what &apos;s coming from that rock .
so as we flew by away from it , we looked back . and guess what ?
you just drive to the nearest lake , stick your ho@@ se in it , and you &apos;ve got your car filled up .
so if we start to think expon@@ entially , we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us .
we have the ability to do more powerful things with them .
and of course , there &apos;s an app for that .
you can twe@@ et your weight to your friends , and they can keep you in line .
how about au@@ g@@ menting the physician ?
so a few examples : we &apos;re now in the era of &quot; fantastic voy@@ age , &quot; the i@@ pill .
in genom@@ ics now , the genome cost about a billion dollars about 10 years ago when the first one came out .
we can be preven@@ tative ; that prevention can be personalized ; and more importantly , it &apos;s going to become increasingly partici@@ pat@@ ory .
we &apos;ve been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of topics , particularly in cardi@@ o@@ vascular disease .
the first one is dedicated to sp@@ en@@ cer , and his grandmother , who was shocked by his work .
in those days there was still coun@@ try@@ side close to the city , farms , cor@@ n@@ fields , cows ; even not far from our building with its bl@@ ur@@ red bri@@ ck and long sha@@ dow@@ y hall@@ way you could find trac@@ ts with hills and trees you could pretend were mountains and forests .
the girl , my old love , the last lost time i saw her when she came to find me at a party , her dr@@ un@@ k@@ enly stu@@ mbling , falling , spra@@ wling , sk@@ ir@@ t hi@@ ked , eyes ve@@ ined red , sw@@ ol@@ len with tears , her shame , her di@@ sh@@ on@@ or .
this is called &quot; thir@@ st . &quot;
a ca@@ sual im@@ pulse , a fancy , never thought of until now , hardly thought of even now ...
the girls , to my horror , a@@ ver@@ ted their ga@@ ze .
c@@ .@@ k. willi@@ ams : poetry of youth and age
sa@@ mu@@ el pi@@ sa@@ r , an a@@ us@@ ch@@ wit@@ z survi@@ vor , said , and i &apos;ll quote him , &quot; the ho@@ lo@@ cau@@ st teaches us that nature , even in its cru@@ ele@@ st moments , is ben@@ ign in comparison with man , when he lo@@ ses his moral compas@@ s and his reason . &quot;
but images don &apos;t need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war .
what we &apos;re going to try and do today , in the 16 and a bit minutes i &apos;ve got left , is to try and answer three questions . the first one is , why ?
that was our h@@ f radio anten@@ na .
two nor@@ we@@ gi@@ ans did it as a team in 2000 . no one &apos;s done it sol@@ o .
when the ice was flat or flat@@ tish , i could just about pull both .
some pretty radical technology , a radical approach -@@ -@@ but it worked perfectly .
i took a photo of that . sat down on my sle@@ dge . did a sort of video di@@ ary piece .
i thought , it &apos;ll have to do .
this is probably why i didn &apos;t get into trouble about the length of my air@@ strip .
since then , no one has ever ski@@ ed -- this was 9@@ 3 years ago -- since then , no one has ever ski@@ ed from the coast of antarctica to the pole and back .
but i was still concerned , so i said , &quot; you know what , i &apos;m not going to do it . &quot;
and i remembered that the old and dr@@ un@@ ken guy came one day to the lab wanting to make some easy cash and this was the guy .
i do want to leave you with one positive thought .
but what if we looked at fear in a fresh way ?
these were the fears that dan@@ ced in the imag@@ inations of these poor men , and as it turned out , the fear they chose to listen to would gover@@ n whether they lived or died .
what would happen to our minds ?
the no@@ ve@@ list v@@ la@@ di@@ m@@ ir n@@ ab@@ ok@@ o@@ v said that the best read@@ er has a combination of two very different temper@@ am@@ ents , the artistic and the scientific .
i &apos;m 4@@ 3 years old right now .
therefore , they asked their parents to go down to the streets and collect them , bring them back home .
and while this was the major difference between many initi@@ a@@ tives before to create change , before we thought , and governments told us -- and even sometimes it was true -- that change was im@@ posed on us , and people reje@@ cted that , because they thought that it is alien to their culture .
i remember one night when someone ph@@ oned me on my cell@@ phone -- ordinary person who i don &apos;t know -- from tah@@ ri@@ r square .
is this a stor@@ y-@@ of-@@ the-@@ year , a stor@@ y-@@ of-@@ the-@@ decade or something more ?
they &apos;ve had some speakers there .
and fran@@ kie says , &quot; i &apos;m number 22 in line , and i can see the needle coming down towards me , and there is blood all over the place .
you don &apos;t want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a to@@ oth@@ brush even with someone you &apos;re sleeping with .
so what we &apos;ve been doing in the united states is re@@ viewing the data -- end@@ lessly re@@ viewing the data .
they are gay men on the party scene who have , on average , three times more partners than straight people on the party scene .
but it is changing the equation of what &apos;s rational in sexual decision-making .
what does that mean ?
there are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet , and that &apos;s one of the gl@@ ories of human existence .
and i &apos;d pull her out on the front por@@ ch .
it &apos;s called cla@@ w@@ -@@ ham@@ mer style , that he had learned from his mother and grandmother .
it sounds something like this .
we were standing on the edge of thousands of ac@@ res of cotton .
now , my mother hop@@ ed that we learned from that the value of hard work .
good news : ch@@ ari@@ ot &apos;s coming .
but then , when i thought about it beyond that , it was very simple things .
and we moved across the street from michael and john whit@@ ney .
they said they were going to beat us up if we didn &apos;t make some gun@@ pow@@ der for them .
so let me put them all together . and also , i can change the sounds by ste@@ pping on this pe@@ dal right here , and -- let me just close out here by doing you a little ha@@ mb@@ one sol@@ o or something like this .
not only is there a relationship between the eth@@ ics of science and the eth@@ ics of being a citizen in democracy , but there has been , historically , a relationship between how people think about space and time , and what the cosmo@@ s is , and how people think about the society that they live in .
and mer@@ ging them together to make the final quantum theory of space and time and gravity , is the cul@@ mination of that , something that &apos;s going on right now .
now , darwin taught us that there are processes of self-@@ organization that suff@@ ice to explain all of us and everything we see .
in fact , i &apos;m finished . science will never go away .
i can see my work as a job . i do it for money .
so i looked for furniture .
he can seat , throughout the year , he can seat 8,000 people .
what came out of it ?
there is a full-@@ blown orchestra living inside the building .
these are some pictures visit@@ ors sent to me .
and the monkeys in that monkey forest looked , actually , fairly happy .
so even as we share death as a universal experience , it &apos;s not experienced the same way the world over .
and it &apos;s also a moment of self-@@ awareness .
but i see something profoundly transformative in experiencing death as a social process and not just a biological one .
one of the -- thank you for inv@@ iting us .
but you do meet some fantastic people , people who look at the world in a totally different way .
&quot; i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve only got 18 minutes , 18 minutes to talk about saving the world , saving the planet , global institutions .
why would you do that ? why would -- it &apos;s like one step up from re@@ plying to one of those emails from nigeria , isn &apos;t it ?
but we have a new hope . we have a new man .
and he spoke to the crowd in chicago , he said , &quot; if there is anyone out there who still doub@@ ts that america is a place where all things are possible ... &quot;
do you remember that ? george bush , &quot; a nu@@ -@@ ca@@ -@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; i was held in prison for nearly 30 years on an island in the middle of the ocean .
and there &apos;s lots of different shapes .
and so every time they found something that looked a little different , they named it something different .
they don &apos;t like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside .
so people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are .
what &apos;s interesting is the spi@@ ke on the back of the dr@@ ac@@ ore@@ x was growing very fast as well .
and then , because the juven@@ iles are in my collection , i cut them open and look inside .
here &apos;s another one .
now as you can imagine , this is not very popular with four@@ th-@@ gra@@ ders .
and it &apos;s a respon@@ sive system that &apos;s trained on actual weather .
anyway , moving along .
so , un@@ folded it &apos;s about 300 linear feet .
the view is den@@ ied in the gall@@ eries where we receive just natural light , and then exposed again in the north gallery with a pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic view .
wait a minute , it &apos;s just in that state , we have a long way to go .
and this is a mo@@ ck@@ up that is in salt lake city that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-@@ scale .
even in stories on gen@@ der@@ -based violence , men get an overwhelming majority of print space and air@@ time .
what she found was many of these stories tend to blame victims and de@@ value their lives .
putting them there made them more recogn@@ iz@@ able .
she was the c@@ bs news correspon@@ dent who was bru@@ t@@ ally sexually assa@@ ul@@ ted in egypt &apos;s tah@@ ri@@ r square right after this photo was taken .
the bot@@ an@@ ical names are in front of you .
&quot; be the change you want to see in the world , &quot; said ma@@ hat@@ ma gandhi .
pm : so is this a good idea .
and so that happened more at various times , but i really think that there was a great advantage in many ways to being a woman .
so being an american , i decided to set up a ca@@ uc@@ us .
the other thing that i think is really important : a lot of national security policy isn &apos;t just about foreign policy , but it &apos;s about bud@@ gets , military bud@@ gets , and how the deb@@ ts of countries work out .
so , yeah .
great news . it drives me nuts that most people don &apos;t seem to know this news .
now i know that some of you think this progress is all in asia or latin america or model countries like brazil -- and who doesn &apos;t love a braz@@ i@@ lian model ? -- but look at sub-saharan africa .
right now today , in os@@ lo as it happens , oil companies are fighting to keep secret their pay@@ ments to governments for extrac@@ ting oil in developing countries .
by doing so , you will join us and coun@@ tless others in what i truly believe is the greatest adventure ever taken , the ever@@ -@@ deman@@ ding journey of equality .
so now , if you take this metaphor &#91; of &#93; genome as program seriously , you have to consider that chris anderson is a compu@@ ter-@@ fab@@ ri@@ cated arti@@ fact , as is jim wat@@ son , cra@@ ig ven@@ ter , as are all of us .
you &apos;re going to design something like a cell phone , and in a high-@@ level language , you &apos;ll describe that cell phone .
so , this is normal dna , what you think of as normal dna .
we heat them up , we add a little bit of salt , we heat them up to almost bo@@ iling and cool them down , and as we cool them down , the short strands b@@ ind the long strands and start to form structure .
she wrote all her own software to design and built this dna origami , a beautiful ren@@ di@@ tion of china , which even has tai@@ wan , and you can see it &apos;s sort of on the world &apos;s shor@@ test le@@ ash , right ?
it was started by eri@@ k win@@ free , and what it does , it has tiles that are a hundre@@ dth the size of a dna origami .
and if you do that , the origami &apos;s the same size , but the resul@@ ting square that you get is three times bigger .
and i think in the next five or 10 years , we &apos;ll make the kind of squares that i described and maybe even get to some of those self-@@ assemb@@ led circuits .
when life brought about a series of death and near@@ -@@ death experiences within my close circle , which high@@ lighted the need for an emergency medical response service in india , similar to 9@@ 11 in usa .
yet , if you analyze the common man , he or she does not wake up every day and say , &quot; h@@ mm , let me see who i can pay a bri@@ be to today . &quot;
it can be worth up to one trillion dollars , being paid in bri@@ bes every year , or equal to india &apos;s gdp .
a set of people actually say , &quot; oh , let me just grant it to them , and run away from it . &quot;
so the data that you &apos;ve got is a great thing called youtube , and we can go down and basically pull all the open information from youtube , all the comm@@ ents , all the views , who &apos;s watching it , where are they watching it , what are they saying in the comm@@ ents .
so as we go in here , what we start to see , apply the physics engine again , we see what &apos;s one conversation is actually com@@ posed of many smaller ones .
well here &apos;s one by j@@ es@@ sic@@ a green about the microbial ecology of buildings .
ma@@ scul@@ in@@ ity mi@@ mic@@ ked by men who grew up with no fathers , cam@@ ou@@ fla@@ ge wor@@ n by bul@@ lies who are danger@@ ously armed but need hu@@ gs .
invest , invest , invest . &quot;
a wise person knows how to improvi@@ se , as lu@@ ke did when he re-@@ wa@@ shed the floor .
all they had was mike &apos;s hard le@@ mon@@ ade , which was five percent alcohol .
we can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis .
don &apos;t get me wrong . we need rules !
all we ask is , &quot; what ser@@ ves my interests ? &quot;
be proud that you have them .
so there &apos;s a lot here at ted , and at other places , to celebrate .
if you do that , the rest is just pretty much a coast down@@ hill .
they have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers .
they &apos;ve been watching too much &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator . &quot;
it turned out , as i think you could see in ai@@ me@@ e &apos;s capabilities and attitudes , people with a desire to do something are quite remarkable and nature is quite adap@@ table .
i &apos;ll give you some ast@@ ounding things that have happened as we started this .
he was le@@ an@@ ing on his other arm .
and i get a call and we go back to washington .
i said , &quot; what am i going to say ?
it is an easy answer .
it &apos;s the path@@ fin@@ der that shows us a simple road through an im@@ penetr@@ able moral ma@@ ze .
the earth moved for both of them .
there was so many skep@@ tics , especially the press in london , that they started flying chee@@ se@@ bur@@ gers on helicop@@ ters around my box to temp@@ t me .
so , i went to talk to a doctor friend , and i asked him how could i do that ?
and then there is static ap@@ ne@@ a .
he &apos;s six foot four . he &apos;s 1@@ 60 pounds .
this was a critical mistake .
and what he did in response , is he went on reg@@ is and kel@@ ly , and broke his old record .
which was making me more nervous .
it was awful .
i was like &quot; what ? &quot;
now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper and immediately get the bul@@ le@@ tin .
teacher : now move it either side . see what happens .
it &apos;s just going to do a tiny bit of processing to convert that image that we just took into a sort of digital finger@@ print , and the great thing is , if you &apos;re a professional user , -- so , a newspaper -- the tools are pretty much identical to what we &apos;ve just used to create this demonstration .
for those of us in this room , it &apos;s not just the poorest and the most vulnerable individual , it &apos;s the community , it &apos;s the culture , it &apos;s the world itself .
last week , bill clinton at the ted a@@ wards said , &quot; this situation is unprecedented , une@@ qu@@ al , unfair and un@@ stable . &quot;
many of you , i think , have probably tre@@ k@@ ked here .
we &apos;ve seen the eradi@@ cation of smallpox .
it is something to be great@@ ly optimistic about .
and when they did , they took smallpox to 10 other countries and re@@ ign@@ ited the epidemic .
there isn &apos;t a dog on this earth that &apos;s a natural creature .
well , they &apos;ve now taken that gene , that biolumines@@ cent gene , and put it into mam@@ mal cells .
so even as we worry about it , we have allowed it to go on in this country -- much different in europe -- without any regu@@ lation , and even without any identi@@ fication on the package .
and it rais@@ es the question of how we &apos;re going to define animal species in the age of bi@@ otechnology -- a question that we &apos;re not really sure yet how to solve .
we &apos;ve taken away the autonomy of this animal . &quot;
this is a mouse created by charles vac@@ ant@@ i of the university of mass@@ achu@@ set@@ ts .
we are directly designing the future of the species of this planet .
and he went on to say , &quot; these differences do not coinci@@ de with correspon@@ ding differences in climate . &quot;
but u@@ v@@ b and u@@ va especially , came in un@@ im@@ pe@@ ded .
there was natural selection for the evolution of lightly pi@@ gmented skin .
so we have , in skin pi@@ g@@ mentation , one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today .
you , you can teach it .
so let me show you a few objects .
to the right , i took a higher rough@@ ness .
why so ? because , in fact , the area of the lung is something very il@@ l-@@ defined .
well , they do mix .
i played with it for a while , and i made it return to the origin .
so the idea there was that one must be able to -- how do you say ? -- model price variation .
it &apos;s so un@@ interesting .
ben@@ o@@ it man@@ del@@ bro@@ t : frac@@ tals and the art of rough@@ ness
so , imagine that all of you are participants in the study .
here &apos;s an example of the puzzle you &apos;re going to solve .
so , you &apos;re putting in less juice , and therefore the outcome : fewer puzzles solved .
right ? a patient in the driver &apos;s seat , for example .
not because there was not enough food -- because there was actually a sur@@ plus of food in the fer@@ tile regions of the south parts of the country -- but because in the north , people could not access or enti@@ tle themselves to that food .
did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors ?
to give you an example , between 2001 and 2002 , ethiop@@ ian ma@@ ize farmers produced two years of bu@@ mp@@ er harvest .
in the american mid@@ west , farmers used to load grain onto bar@@ ges and send it u@@ pri@@ ver to the chicago market .
that means that the exchange will operate a trading system , which will initially start as an open out@@ cry , because we don &apos;t think the country &apos;s ready for full electronic trading .
we believe that the sta@@ kes are high , but that the re@@ turns will be even greater .
it is always the same , never the same , end@@ lessly fascinating .
that &apos;s a potential scenario if we fail to take this seriously .
it provides a physical support structure for the trees , and it creates physical spaces , habit@@ able spaces inside of the sand dun@@ es .
then , a few years afterwards , using per@@ mac@@ ul@@ tural strategies , we green that part of the desert .
it &apos;s not only something that suppor@@ ts trees , but something that connects people and countries together .
i paid to get it re@@ pa@@ ired -- then it broke again .
if this idea is truly sound , then the implications are significant .
he &apos;s b@@ are@@ foot . he &apos;ll run back into his house , and he will conta@@ minate his drinking water and his food and his environment with whatever diseases he may be carrying by fe@@ cal particles that are on his fingers and feet .
we don &apos;t have a neutral word for it .
and you might think it &apos;s just good kar@@ ma to see these guys stir@@ ring shit , but it &apos;s also good economic sense , because they &apos;re saving a million dollars a year .
she grew up in a rural village in a poor area of india , and she was engaged at 14 , and then at 21 or so , she moved into her in-@@ law &apos;s house .
it &apos;s the most off-@@ track millennium development goal .
and that was what i did .
there are tens of thousands of those stories out there , and it &apos;s really hard to con@@ j@@ ure up much of a sense of well-being , because it just keeps getting worse .
and we tra@@ wl , which means to take something the size of a trac@@ tor tra@@ iler truck that weigh@@ s thousands and thousands of pounds , put it on a big chain , and drag it across the sea floor to sti@@ r up the bottom and catch the fish .
but since we ate all the oy@@ sters and we ate all the fish that would eat the plan@@ k@@ ton , there &apos;s nothing to eat the plan@@ k@@ ton and there &apos;s more and more of it , so it dies of old age , which is un@@ heard of for plan@@ k@@ ton .
and then , of course , there &apos;s climate change , and we all know about climate change .
but there are these , what we call , positive feed@@ backs , the sy@@ ner@@ gies among them that make the whole va@@ stly greater than the sum of the parts .
in this br@@ ac@@ ing talk , coral reef eco@@ logist jer@@ e@@ my j@@ ack@@ son lays out the shocking state of the ocean today : over@@ fi@@ shed , over@@ he@@ ated , pollu@@ ted , with indi@@ ca@@ tors that things will get much worse . astonishing photos and st@@ ats make the case .
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s not true .
that this old man would inter@@ rupt his mo@@ on@@ light stro@@ ll with his swee@@ the@@ art with the precise reason of making fun of a child .
i went with my friend tim mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al , who sat on my left .
the sand@@ worms were fine , but your favorite character ?
does something seem strange about this to you ?
she was a single woman about to go alone into a country , not even speaking the language , to travel alone by bus and boat to go to a beach she did not know or had never seen .
she was smiling . she did not understand why i was so worried .
but i think we should also just check the numbers , take a reality check here .
joseph sch@@ um@@ peter called this &quot; the process of creative destruction . &quot;
is this really how economies behave ? &quot;
what is the objective ?
what does all this mean for economics ?
but it &apos;s also clear that prosperity goes beyond this .
i mean , can you picture a politician standing up in britain and saying , &quot; gdp fell two percent this year . good news !
i painted it directly on top of the man .
i made the tough decision of going home after gradu@@ ation and not going up to capit@@ ol hill , but going down to my parents &apos; base@@ ment and making it my job to learn how to paint .
when we started out on the milk project , and when i started out , i couldn &apos;t have fore@@ seen that i would go from pursu@@ ing my dream in politics and working at a desk to tri@@ pping over a shadow and then turning people into paintings and painting on people in a pool of milk .
and it goes all the way over to these big , thick , gal@@ um@@ ph@@ y ones that have hundreds of carb@@ ons , and they have thousands of hydro@@ gens , and they have van@@ adi@@ um and heavy metals and sul@@ fur and all kinds of cra@@ z@@ iness hanging off the sides of them .
they set the prices , and i don &apos;t even know .
okay , so the politics of oil are very moral in the united states .
and we take it as , you know -- we look at it on a moral level , rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level .
in fact , it &apos;s continued to increase .
this is 198@@ 8 -- we actually bom@@ bed two iranian oil platforms that year .
what you see in this top drawing is a sche@@ matic of how petro@@ le@@ um gets used in the u.s. economy .
that &apos;s a lot .
we are running late .
now you &apos;d think that &quot; american i@@ do@@ l &quot; would introduce a measure of americ@@ an@@ ization .
and that swim took me 18 minutes and 50 seconds , and it felt like 18 days .
and to the right hand side of us was this great k@@ hu@@ mb@@ u glac@@ ier .
we want you to walk up the hill in another two days &apos; time .
after he swa@@ m the north pole , lewis pu@@ gh vo@@ wed never to take another col@@ d-@@ water di@@ p . then he heard of lake im@@ ja in the hi@@ malay@@ as , created by recent glac@@ ial melting , and lake pu@@ mor@@ i , a body of water at an altitude of 5@@ 300 m on everest -- and so began a journey that would teach him a radical new way to approach swimming and think about climate change .
this is a state diagram . that &apos;s an extremely simple computer .
i thought about this in the sense that it &apos;s great to build in biological materials , but can we do similar things ?
so i was trying to , you know , take the engineer &apos;s version : can we build a mechanical system in in@@ organic materials that will do the same thing ?
and literally with only those two in@@ puts -- so , the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure -- you can define an infinite number of len@@ ses that cover the range of human ref@@ rac@@ tive error , from minus 12 to plus eight di@@ op@@ ters , up to four di@@ op@@ ters of cylinder .
but they can show you how to build things in sequence .
you could just hang it as a bed sheet , but again , the computation of all the physics gives you the aero@@ dynamic shape .
and the correlation , of course , is that den@@ ser places tend to have lower emissions -- which isn &apos;t really all that difficult to figure out , if you think about it .
this is a ma@@ p@@ nific@@ ent map that shows me , in this case , how far i can get from my home in 30 minutes using public transportation .
which brings on another threshold effect i like to call fur@@ n@@ ace du@@ mping , which is , quite simply , if you have a building that doesn &apos;t need to be he@@ ated with a fur@@ n@@ ace , you save a whole bunch of money up front .
during the tw@@ enti@@ e@@ th century , we witnessed the at@@ ro@@ cities of stal@@ in , hit@@ ler , ma@@ o , po@@ l pot , rwanda and other genoci@@ des , and even though the twenty-@@ first century is only seven years old , we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in dar@@ fur and the daily hor@@ rors of iraq .
according to non-@@ govern@@ mental organizations that keep such statistics , since 19@@ 45 , in europe and the ameri@@ cas , there has been a ste@@ ep decline in inter@@ state wars , in deadly ethnic ri@@ ots or po@@ gro@@ ms , and in military cou@@ ps , even in south america . worldwide , there &apos;s been a ste@@ ep decline in deaths in inter@@ state wars . the yellow bars here show the number of deaths per war per year from 19@@ 50 to the present .
so that &apos;s a bit of a support for the le@@ vi@@ athan theory .
in fact , it &apos;s as large as western europe , but it only has 300 miles of pa@@ ved roads .
now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a con@@ dom .
and what is the definition then ? &quot; the definition ?
we have lib@@ eria . we have congo .
you can watch me for one minute now and you &apos;ll see the whole thing .
and asia could have social development before they got the economic development .
but more or less , this is what will happen , and we have a world which cannot be looked upon as divided .
and then it &apos;s united states today , up here .
and we had an increase in income .
the middle income countries , the emerging economy , they are catching up .
about 20 percent of the adult population are infected .
it &apos;s caused by fast processing of toxic ca@@ ssa@@ va root in famine situation .
and we have a high hope in you . thank you very much .
next best thing to a video game .
you have them in hun@@ ter-@@ gather@@ er societies , but then through technological evolution , new forms of technology ari@@ se that fac@@ il@@ itate or encourage the playing of non-zero-sum games , invol@@ ving more people over larger territory .
and i would say the non-zero-sum dynamic is only going to grow more intense over time because of technological trends , but more intense in a kind of negative way .
it &apos;s when people &apos;s fortun@@ es are cor@@ related .
i think it &apos;s the first step toward that . that &apos;s the long-term goal .
the g@@ 8 summit pro@@ poses that the solution to africa &apos;s problems should be a massive increase in aid , something ak@@ in to the mar@@ shall plan .
but equally , it has opportunities and a lot of potential .
well , since i &apos;m not seeing the hand , it appears that what i &apos;m st@@ ating is true .
well , because it gives them good , paying jobs , or , in many african countries , u@@ no@@ ffici@@ al opportunities to profit from corruption .
governments are not changing it . why ?
there were 5@@ 6 , and when our president wanted to am@@ end the constitu@@ tion and remove term limits , he had to create 25 new distri@@ cts , and now there are 8@@ 1 .
doctor se@@ lig@@ man , what is the state of psychology today ? &quot;
and the conclusion of that is that psychology and psychiat@@ ry , over the last 60 years , can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable .
i &apos;ve spent my life working on extremely miserable people , and i &apos;ve asked the question , how do extremely miserable people diff@@ er from the rest of you ?
so i want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them .
when he walks onto the floor of the american exchange at 9 : 30 in the morning , time stops for him . and it stops till the closing bell .
and meaning , in this view , consi@@ sts of -- very parallel to eu@@ da@@ im@@ on@@ ia -- it consi@@ sts of knowing what your highest streng@@ ths are , and using them to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are .
so , the next to last thing i want to say is we &apos;re interested in how much life satisfaction people have .
but they were empty .
these are cam@@ els moving across the ri@@ ft valley in africa , photographed by chris joh@@ ns .
now i have to tell you , i was talking to k@@ y@@ le last week about this , that i was going to tell this story .
a lion having a late night s@@ n@@ ack -- notice he &apos;s got a broken to@@ oth .
for the first time in history , more people live in urban , rather than rural , environments .
brian photographed a marine san@@ c@@ tu@@ ary in new zealand , where commercial fishing had been ban@@ ned -- the result being that the over@@ fi@@ shed species have been re@@ stored , and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisher@@ ies .
but then paul got in the water .
david gri@@ ff@@ in : how photography connects us
so , if we use information that comes off of this spe@@ cular reflection , we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gross cont@@ ours of the face and the basic shape , and au@@ gment it with information that puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wr@@ ink@@ les .
we can turn the volume up a little bit if that &apos;s available .
what i &apos;ve been doing from 14 to 17 was , i was assi@@ sting them collecting i@@ v@@ ory tu@@ s@@ k , meat and whatever they were killing , po@@ aching , hunting in the forest , bring it in the main city to get access to the market .
here we have sa@@ van@@ na gi@@ ra@@ ff@@ es , but through evolution we have this forest gi@@ ra@@ ff@@ e that lives only in congo .
you can &apos;t ask him how old he is because he has guns .
and that was the language of the war .
and they can &apos;t do what they are doing .
and one day , we went for a meeting .
i op@@ pose it -- that they are now going to disse@@ ct it , until i do my report and then i see the chief comman@@ der .
see what the wars in rwanda .
building capac@@ ities for the young generation is going to make a better generation and a better future tomorrow for africa .
did you know that , in iraq and afghanistan , there were more private military contrac@@ tors on the ground than there were u.s. military troops ?
let &apos;s see what people here think about it .
oh , after you stopped paying .
for fear of disagre@@ ement , we shr@@ ink from these questions .
some of the reasons for this are not really very controversial .
the vertical axis now is thousands of dollars in today &apos;s prices .
all the rest went to the top one percent .
that comes out at five to 10 tons daily per square mile in cities .
you have to choose either option a or option b .
and some people would say that we &apos;re born with it in some other means .
everything except random@@ ness . she did not believe in random@@ ness .
and that &apos;s what i look for in my work , a personal meaning .
but , both of these sa@@ y@@ ings -- saving a fish from drow@@ ning , or saving a man from drow@@ ning -- to me they had to do with inten@@ tions .
it may be something that is perhaps more serious -- as i said , human rights in bur@@ ma .
well , what is random ? what is chance ? what is luck ?
i was able to see that in a fir@@ s@@ th@@ and way , when i went to beautiful d@@ ong village , in gu@@ iz@@ ho@@ u , the poorest provin@@ ce of china .
i believe in speci@@ f@@ ics , the speci@@ f@@ ics of story , and the past , the speci@@ f@@ ics of that past , and what is happening in the story at that point .
and the reason is that until wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sli@@ ced bread , no one wanted it .
right . i go to the del@@ i ; i &apos;m sick ; i need to buy some medicine .
who &apos;s going to stop and pull over and say -- oh , look , a cow . nobody .
they turned a chair from something the purcha@@ sing department bought , to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work .
talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends .
am@@ i@@ hot@@ or@@ no@@ t@@ .com -- everyday 2@@ 50,000 people go to this site , run by two volunteers , and i can tell you they are hard gra@@ ders , and they didn &apos;t get this way by advertising a lot .
silk . put a product that does not need to be in the refriger@@ ated section next to the milk in the refriger@@ ated section .
in a world of too many options and too little time , our obvious choice is to just ignore the ordinary stuff . marketing gur@@ u se@@ th god@@ in spe@@ lls out why , when it comes to getting our attention , bad or bizarre ideas are more successful than boring ones .
now , speaking of walls , i want to share with you the story of one wall in ca@@ ir@@ o .
most of the economic models are built around scar@@ city and growth .
if we can make it through the next 150 years , i think that your great great grandchildren will forget all about mal@@ thus .
the problem is that these pu@@ ps need a stable platform of solid ice in order to nurse from their mom@@ s .
we can &apos;t keep taking without expecting serious consequences as a result .
i didn &apos;t want them to be over@@ ly threat@@ ening or scary .
here we see a female cra@@ wling out of the ocean under mo@@ on@@ light on the island of trin@@ id@@ ad .
72 percent of the population has such sc@@ ars , but most don &apos;t shed the gear , things like lo@@ b@@ ster tra@@ ps and cra@@ b po@@ ts .
i worked in other parts of new zealand as well , in beautiful , fragile , protected areas like in fi@@ or@@ d@@ land , where this sea pen colony was found .
it &apos;s horrible . it &apos;s a proof of our failing to save them in the wild .
when i stood there in the grass , it &apos;s hot -- not even the sound of insects -- just this wa@@ ving grass .
now in this recipe you also have the cost .
and once the soil gets dri@@ ed , you &apos;re in a dry season -- you get cr@@ acks , oxygen goes in , fla@@ mes come out and the problem starts all over again .
but , it &apos;s more complicated . it &apos;s not that simple , and you have to work with the people .
and this is after two years .
and look , there &apos;s now 1@@ 1.@@ 2 percent more clouds -- already , after three years .
but whatever you do in that program , it has to be fully supported by the people , meaning that you also have to adjust it to the local , cultural values .
all the sculp@@ tures move by mechanical means .
it sounds good , but i &apos;ll bet you know in your gut that it &apos;s not the whole truth , and i &apos;ll tell you why .
and i wa@@ ited , and the next day i liked it a bit better , the next day i liked it a bit better , and now i really love it .
free@@ ways .
what i &apos;m trying to say is the major contribution on carbon emissions are from the cars -- more than 50 percent -- so when we depend only on cars , it &apos;s ...
you should have always a structure of living and working together .
and we cannot have all the answers .
okay , now why then is this curious re@@ luc@@ tance and curious hosti@@ l@@ ity to consciousness ?
how could spir@@ itu@@ ality move anything ?
and just as the j@@ ar full of water can go from liquid to solid depending on the behavior of the molecules , so your brain can go from a state of being conscious to a state of being unconscious , depending on the behavior of the molecules .
okay , the next feature of consciousness , after this mar@@ vel@@ ous uni@@ fied conscious field , is that it functions ca@@ us@@ ally in our behavior .
it &apos;s only relative to conscious agents that a piece of paper is money or that a bunch of buildings is a university .
i won &apos;t demonstrate pain behavior , but i can tell you i &apos;m not having any pa@@ ins right now .
but i believe there &apos;s a second climate crisis , which is as severe , which has the same origins , and that we have to deal with with the same ur@@ gency .
and human resources are like natural resources ; they &apos;re often buried deep .
we must di@@ sen@@ th@@ r@@ all ourselves , and then we shall save our country . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t see the point .
he said , &quot; as a kid . &quot; he said , &quot; actually , it was a problem for me at school , because at school , everybody wanted to be a fire@@ man . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;ve been around for 36 months , and this is it ? &quot;
you know this , if you &apos;re doing something you love , an hour feels like five minutes .
he wrote this to his love , ma@@ ud gon@@ ne , and he was be@@ wa@@ iling the fact that he couldn &apos;t really give her what he thought she wanted from him .
now what &apos;s interesting about that is ir@@ regular ver@@ bs between al@@ f@@ red and ja@@ y-@@ z have become more regular .
so i think in the next decade , the sciences and the human@@ ities will come closer together to be able to answer deep questions about mankind .
and so i got some training and went and worked in africa during most of my 20s .
and she walked forward with such calm and such clar@@ ity and such total lack of fear that she could walk right up to the first gun , put her hand on it and lower it .
but anger is like gasoline , and if you spray it around and somebody lights a match , you &apos;ve got an in@@ fer@@ no .
and what they &apos;ve realized is that using violence in the situations they operate in is not only less human@@ e , but it &apos;s less effective than using methods that connect people with people , that rebuild .
it &apos;s flo@@ wn around the world .
do you mind if we do something completely different ?
you could say , well , it doesn &apos;t look very different from when he started .
and is art about trying to imagine what lies beyond the horizon ?
if you look down , you can &apos;t see your feet .
and thanks to the people of interface , i have become a reco@@ vering pl@@ under@@ er .
thinking it through , i realized that all those attribu@@ tes must be changed to move t to the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator .
we re@@ ck@@ on that we are a bit over halfway to our goal : zero impact , zero footprint .
i remain troub@@ led by the revi@@ sed e@@ h@@ r@@ li@@ ch equation , i equ@@ als p times a divided by t@@ 2 .
because it told me , by god , one person got it .
while we initially her@@ al@@ ded the internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems , we now realize that the internet is , if anything , too effective in that regard .
and at heart , both re@@ forma@@ tions , i think were asking the questions : who &apos;s enti@@ tled to practice ?
today &apos;s professional theater community is defined , not only the sha@@ w and str@@ at@@ ford festiv@@ als , but by the cor@@ ner@@ stone theater of los angeles -- a collective of artists that after 9 / 11 , brought together 10 different religious communities -- the ba@@ hi@@ a , the catholic , the muslim , the jewish , even the native american and the gay and le@@ s@@ bian communities of faith , helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play , where they explo@@ red the differences in their faith and found common@@ ality as an important first step toward cross-@@ community healing .
we want to play you one more selection .
and that &apos;s how i got out of high school .
at a re@@ ception in their cour@@ ty@@ ard , i noticed that they had a foun@@ tain because they think that the people who go to the museum deserve a foun@@ tain .
and so the next thing you &apos;ll see is a million dollar kitchen that was built by the he@@ in@@ z company -- you &apos;ve heard of them ?
we have students who sit together , black kids and white kids , and what we &apos;ve discovered is you can solve the race problem by creating a world class environment , because people will have a tendency to show you world class behavior if you treat them in that way .
that &apos;s our library with more hand@@ cra@@ fted furniture .
he was dra@@ gging guys out of bars and saving those lives for the lord .
she said , &quot; well , i work for a company called he@@ w@@ let@@ t-@@ pack@@ ard . &quot;
and i want my music to be with you . &quot;
and that &apos;s the building , and that &apos;s the model , and on the right &apos;s a high-tech greenhouse and in the middle &apos;s the medical technology building .
this is in a place called san francisco .
i said , &quot; well , that &apos;s very nice .
because mr. ross used to bring in your albu@@ ms when i was 16 years old in the pot@@ ter@@ y class , when the world was all dark , and your music got me to the sunlight . &quot;
it &apos;s really our first for@@ ay into this .
so it consi@@ sts of two parts , what we call an en@@ co@@ der and a trans@@ duc@@ er .
so let me show you , and i &apos;m going to start with the standard method first .
this man is supposed to represent a gener@@ ic human being , and all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body .
we &apos;re not doing anything to the cells here .
this is like the ste@@ al@@ th bom@@ ber of the ocean .
this is the vi@@ bri@@ o fi@@ sch@@ er@@ i molecule .
they take that information inside , and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who &apos;s in the minority and who &apos;s in the majority of any given population .
we &apos;ve also done the same thing with the pink system .
this is exactly what happens in your body .
look at all the arguments we have these days over health care , over bon@@ uses and ba@@ il@@ outs on wall street , over the gap between rich and poor , over af@@ fir@@ ma@@ tive action and sa@@ me-@@ sex marriage .
actually , that was aristotle &apos;s answer too .
he was a very good gol@@ fer , but he had a disability .
what &apos;s your name ?
is walking the course essential to the game ?
first , no real sports fan would talk that way .
so let &apos;s step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve , elev@@ ate , the terms of political disc@@ our@@ se in the united states , and for that matter , around the world .
michael san@@ de@@ l : the lost art of democratic debate
you know , a lot of people said , &quot; well , you know , city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time .
and , i say that that &apos;s fine -- the future of humanity is enti@@ tled to make that choice .
we &apos;ve discovered things like , for example , r@@ na inter@@ ference only a few years ago , and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work .
the therap@@ ies will be improving faster than the remaining im@@ perfe@@ ctions in the therap@@ ies are catching up with us .
secondly , what does it mean for the public &apos;s perception of how long it &apos;s going to take for us to get to those things , starting from the time we get the mice ?
we can call it the &quot; engineering approach , &quot; and i claim that the engineering approach is within range .
some of them are parti@@ ally imple@@ mented already , the ones at the top .
audience : species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to pro@@ create .
there are species that have no aging -- hy@@ dr@@ a for example -- but they do it by not having a nervous system -- and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very long-@@ lived cells .
and although i want to thank the talented people of our company fore@@ most for that -- and also there &apos;s a factor of luck and timing -- we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values .
i have days that i believe , but i have days that i &apos;m full of doubt .
so we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge .
what happens when a city deci@@ des it &apos;s going to set other priorities ?
according to the center for disease control , fully one third of all children born after 2000 will get diabetes .
and we take car cra@@ shes for granted .
but , of course , we &apos;ve seen what that does .
you don &apos;t want to tell americans , god forbi@@ d , that they have to change their lifestyle .
the second reason is that we killed these things .
well , we looked at the tissue under the microscope .
the first one that we see occurs in the ancient rain@@ forests of australia about 25 million years ago , and the national geographic society is helping us to explore these fossil depos@@ its . this is ri@@ ver@@ sle@@ i@@ gh .
wild dogs did eat a few of the sheep , but the th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine got a bad ra@@ p .
they &apos;re related di@@ stantly to th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ines .
he thought hard . i mean , it was nearly 80 years before this that he &apos;d been at this hu@@ t .
it &apos;s very , very difficult to speak at the end of a conference like this , because everyone has spoken . everything has been said .
now , why is all this important , to have to go really fast ?
creating our own program to solve problems , like fighting corruption , building institutions , stabi@@ li@@ zing the mic@@ ro economy .
is it being dire@@ cted effectively ?
it was really hot . i was very hungry .
and now let me become less senti@@ mental , and say that saving lives -- which some of the aid we get does on this continent -- when you save the life of anyone , a farmer , a teacher , a mother , they are contribu@@ ting produc@@ tively into the economy .
when we ask them and tell them what we need , one of my wor@@ ries today is that we have many foundations now .
our in@@ ability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money , &quot; sit down . &quot;
aid cannot solve our problems , i &apos;m fir@@ m@@ ly convinced about that .
a lot has been said here about women , i don &apos;t need to repeat it .
i &apos;m going to go over some science experiments and try to cover three musical experiments .
and so all of us have this remarkable brain , which is po@@ or@@ ly understood to say the least .
you can &apos;t just sort of -- &quot; it &apos;s great we &apos;ve got this keyboard . &quot;
really , consciousness is se@@ ated in the frontal lo@@ be .
c@@ l : at this point , i &apos;ll take a few moments .
so what we had them do was memor@@ ize this lo@@ wer@@ -@@ left sound icon , please .
so just to conclude , we &apos;ve got a lot of questions to ask , and like i said , we &apos;ll ask questions here , not answer them .
look , the world has changed from analo@@ g to digital .
a techn@@ ician will put the electrodes onto the scal@@ p using a conduc@@ tive gel or paste and usually after a procedure of preparing the scal@@ p by light abra@@ sion .
the first time , nothing will happen , because the system has no idea how he thinks about &quot; pull . &quot;
and once you &apos;ve trained up the dete@@ ctions , these thoughts can be as@@ signed or ma@@ pped to any computing platform , application or device .
so i &apos;m going to briefly discuss a couple of problems that we have and a couple of problems where we &apos;ve got some solutions under@@ way .
es@@ ther du@@ fl@@ o talked a little bit about this .
the other thing is , you know , it would be even better if you didn &apos;t have to draw the blood .
there &apos;s all these different interventions but they have different kinds of effe@@ c@@ tiveness .
in 19@@ 35 , there were 1@@ 50,000 cases a year of malaria in the united states , but dd@@ t and a massive public health effort managed to squ@@ el@@ ch it .
now , it turns out we only kill the female mosquit@@ oes .
here we have it running at high-@@ speed mode .
it &apos;s then sold and bought , and it &apos;s then delivered to me .
but i thought , no , no , experiment with re@@ sins , experiment with poly@@ mers .
three com@@ post b@@ ins -- go through about 70 ki@@ los of raw vegetable waste a week -- really good , makes fantastic com@@ post .
very advanced , no air@@ -@@ condi@@ tioning -- i love it .
that &apos;s zero food waste .
basically i &apos;m recording one second of every day of my life for the rest of my life , chron@@ o@@ logically comp@@ iling these one-@@ second tiny sli@@ ces of my life into one single continuous video until , you know , i can &apos;t record them anymore .
it helped me realize something else during this project , is that recording that one second on a really bad day is extremely difficult .
and we can start a film about that , and we can see a little bit backwards in time .
these are the distances of the tubes which make it walk that way .
it &apos;s a binary step counter .
you can only do them one at a time .
i think philosoph@@ ically , that was one of the most important papers that we &apos;ve ever done because it showed how dynamic life was .
so the team developed new de@@ bu@@ gging software , where we could test each synthetic fra@@ gment to see if it would grow in a background of wild type dna .
and we added three quot@@ ations , because with the first genome we were critici@@ zed for not trying to say something more profound than just sig@@ ning the work .
or , more importantly , hiv , where the virus evol@@ ves so quickly the vaccines that are made today can &apos;t keep up with those evolutionary changes .
so i read slowly .
this was perhaps the biggest surprise -- how flexible the koran is , at least in minds that are not fundamentally inf@@ le@@ xi@@ ble .
i study ants , and that &apos;s because i like to think about how organizations work .
and they do that by each year sending out the re@@ produc@@ tives -- those are the ones with wings -- on a mating flight .
and it stays that size until the queen dies and there &apos;s nobody to make more ants , when she &apos;s about 15 or 20 years old .
on one day , it &apos;ll all be here , and then the next day they &apos;ll move it over there , and then they &apos;ll move it back .
they somehow get into this reserve .
well it turns out that yes , the different tasks are inter@@ dependent .
so , the ants in the older colony that seem to be more stable are not any older than the ants in the younger colony .
they &apos;ve gone out to do different tasks , and the rate at which they meet as they come in and out of the nest en@@ trance determines , or influ@@ ences , each ant &apos;s decision about whether to go out , and which task to perform .
but in a small colony , it &apos;s likely to meet fewer for@@ agers , just because there are fewer other for@@ agers there to meet .
but it &apos;s the greatest transfer of wealth , from one group to another in the history of mankind .
yes , it &apos;s going to continue .
it &apos;s 1@@ 30 oct@@ an@@ e fuel .
i don &apos;t have to worry about the bridge to where at my age .
in a nu@@ t@@ shell that &apos;s what happened ?
and so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas .
and number two , do not build a re@@ former on the ocean .
i don &apos;t understand why the media is focused on eastern pen@@ n@@ syl@@ van@@ ia .
bo@@ one , i really , really appreciate you coming here , engaging in this conversation .
&quot; the el@@ dor@@ a@@ do of the united states of america : the discovery of in@@ exha@@ us@@ tible gold mines in california . &quot;
half of them deser@@ ted to go look for gold .
but they spent three and a half million dollars in the 2000 super bowl to air that ad , even though , at the time , they only had a million dollars in annual revenue .
this is work going on down in lower manhattan where they built some of the first electric power generating stations .
this came in , like , six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing clo@@ gging up a light so@@ cket .
and one friend of mine was telling me a story : not only did they get there and have to wait , but then the engineers , when they finally did get there , for the third time , they had to call somebody .
i &apos;m going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history of compassion and the golden rule .
now , there &apos;s more good news that came along later in evolution , a second kind of evolutionary logic .
now , we have a ra@@ tion@@ ale for that .
and if you ask what kind of situation is con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to people defining people as enemies , it &apos;s a zero-sum situation .
it &apos;s why social organization has grown from the hun@@ ter-@@ gather@@ er village to the ancient state , the empire , and now here we are in a glob@@ alized world .
i think politicians can help foster non-zero-sum relationships , economic engagement is generally better than blo@@ ck@@ ades and so on , in this regard .
it &apos;s unfortunate that they tend to be selec@@ tively deployed .
what time of life had they started school ?
he actively sou@@ ght dis@@ con@@ fir@@ mation .
in surve@@ ys of european and american execu@@ tives , fully 85 percent of them ac@@ knowle@@ dged that they had issues or concerns at work that they were afraid to raise .
but he had been so afraid of conflict , until finally he became more afraid of the silence .
so , what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer , sources of cancer , or , for that matter , why you are who you are , didn &apos;t make sense .
so , i decided over the years , because of a series of experiments that this is because of context and architecture .
and we said , wonderful ! look at this pretty structure .
i made a radical hypothesis .
we have shown that there &apos;s little pieces of dna on the specific genes of the mam@@ mary g@@ land that actually respond to extrac@@ el@@ lular matrix .
but here is a poem from ye@@ ats . i &apos;ll just read you the last two lines .
it &apos;s been fantastic .
it sounds a little bit like a weird book , but actually they &apos;re all new types of lies .
he wrote very , very positive re@@ views about himself . surprise , surprise .
my friends , no way they can be that cool and have good of a life .
well , to do that , one thing is we can look at the de@@ cep@@ tion-@@ detection literature .
anybody do any writing today ? did anybody write a word ?
those cold , hard w@@ inter@@ s , i love it .
now , when you are about to say or do something , we can think , do i want this to be part of my legacy , part of my personal record ?
though in all seri@@ ousness , this position that you just saw me in , looking down at my phone , that &apos;s one of the reasons behind this project , project glass .
we had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accepted the job , and then she almost ran away scre@@ aming .
but i do that all the time .
i go back to color all the time .
my mother was , sort of , very sensitive to his mother , who it seemed was a little bit skep@@ tical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing .
i went to performing arts high school , where i was an actor .
and so i had this t@@ .@@ v@@ . show .
and there &apos;s got to be some way to do that , ro@@ si@@ e .
and i often look at things as though they &apos;re food .
chef : oh , you don &apos;t know ? let me tell you something .
fashion designer isa@@ ac mi@@ z@@ ra@@ hi sp@@ ins through a di@@ zz@@ ying array of inspi@@ rations -- from &apos; 50s pin@@ ups to a fle@@ eting glimpse of a woman on the street who makes him sh@@ out &quot; stop the ca@@ b ! &quot; inside this ra@@ mbling talk are real clu@@ es to living a happy , creative life .
and i was actually a potent force in spreading ideas across borders , and i witnessed the rise of isla@@ mist extre@@ mism as distinct from islam the faith , and the way in which it influenced my co-@@ religi@@ on@@ ists across the world .
what &apos;s actually happening is that what were previously loc@@ alized par@@ o@@ chi@@ al@@ isms , individual or grou@@ p@@ ings of extre@@ mi@@ sts who were isolated from one another , have become interconnected in a glob@@ alized way and have thus become , or are becoming , mainstream .
and a social movement is comp@@ ri@@ sed , in my view , it &apos;s comp@@ ri@@ sed of four main characteristics .
the second , i believe , is political corre@@ ct@@ ness .
not exclu@@ sive to these things , but in addition to them , is propag@@ ating a genu@@ ine demand for democracy on the ground .
because it &apos;s not enough to remove a leader or rul@@ er or dict@@ ator .
it isn &apos;t when the sh@@ iny new tools show up that their uses start per@@ me@@ ating society .
the internet is the first medium in history that has native support for groups and conversation at the same time .
the bb@@ c got their first wind of the chinese qua@@ ke from twitter .
and finally the chinese cr@@ acked down .
all of that is over .
he had to issue a re@@ ply .
ok , this is mount everest .
it was a national geographic expedition , but it was organized by the explor@@ ers club .
there &apos;s no ice over it .
from here , it &apos;s about 1,500 feet up at a 30-@@ degree angle to the summit .
this is a view taken along the summit ridge .
it &apos;s really cold ; it &apos;s 2@@ 4,000 feet .
the survi@@ vors came in one by one .
after la@@ ying in the snow that long a time , he got up and found his way back to the camp .
he &apos;s dying .
he was cri@@ tically ill , there were other cri@@ tically ill patients ; luckily , we were able to get a helicopter in to rescue these guys .
so ideas change states .
but a demographic divi@@ d@@ end is only as good as the investment in your human capital .
and then i think the other point is that indians today are far more comfortable with globalization .
it &apos;s certainly not like china .
what are those ideas ? one is , i think , are ide@@ ological issues .
we can use technology for transparency , and many other things .
if we really want to come to a point , we really want to put a cap on our carbon e@@ mission , we want to really lower the use of energy -- it has to be solved in countries like india .
and this is a rain@@ y election day in a small country -- that can be my country , but could be also your country .
so basically i want to ask : what went right and what went wrong in these 50 years when we talk about democracy ?
and you have the market revolution of the 1980s and the huge increase of inequality in societies .
you have facebook revolutions , twitter revolutions .
in a small country that could be my country , but could be also your country , they took a decision -- it is a real case story -- that all of the govern@@ mental decisions , discus@@ sions of the council of mini@@ sters , were going to be published on the internet 24 hours after the council discus@@ sions took place .
the idea is called the social impact bond .
the service provi@@ ders , well , for the first time , they &apos;ve got an opportunity to provide services and grow the evidence for what they &apos;re doing in a really construc@@ tive way and learn and demonstrate the value of what they &apos;re doing over five or six years , not just one or two as often happens at the moment .
it enables testing of new ideas in a way that &apos;s less difficult for everybody .
&quot; ha , i &apos;m the only person i ever loved . &quot;
he goes , &quot; sir , why don &apos;t you drive ? &quot;
why is that ? are you too tired to go all the way around ?
i &apos;m not supposed to be , like , walking down the ais@@ le , and be like , &quot; hi , jack . &quot; you know , that &apos;s not cool .
was@@ su@@ p .
ted@@ x .
decided to use recycled content from cement and steel manufacturing .
we must change everything .
it is transparent , made just for you .
they were missing the vision .
so once those pictures are acquired and the physician has drawn all the necessary safety limits and so on , he selec@@ ts basically a point -- you see the round point in the middle where the cur@@ sor is -- and he pre@@ sses this blue button called &quot; son@@ i@@ cate . &quot;
john is one of &#91; about &#93; a dozen very hero@@ ic , coura@@ geous people who volunte@@ ered for the study .
he &apos;s a 7@@ 8 year-old farmer who suffered from -- how should i say it ? -- it &apos;s called pain in the but@@ t .
i don &apos;t see , without this nation taking it as some collective will or something that is a national goal to make that happen , it will not happen .
so new life was born .
all they have , really , is tra@@ de@@ mark protection , and so it means that anybody could copy any gar@@ ment on any person in this room and sell it as their own design .
now , fashion designers have the bro@@ a@@ dest pal@@ et@@ te imag@@ in@@ able in this creative industry .
one that a lot of cultural cri@@ tics have pointed to is that we now have a much broader pal@@ et@@ te of design choices to choose from than we ever have before , and this is mainly because of the fast fashion industry , actually .
i love these gal@@ li@@ an@@ os .
if you look at the regi@@ stry , actually , a lot of the regi@@ stered things in the e.@@ u .
fire@@ works disp@@ lays , the smell of per@@ fu@@ me : no .
it is barely te@@ thered to any sort of physical reality in our minds .
i &apos;d been traveling in japan without an agenda other than to photograph , and then i heard about this tree that is 2@@ ,@@ 18@@ 0 years old and knew that i had to go visit it .
and then this back down on the ground and you can see that the fung@@ us is actually inv@@ ading this tree .
but i put that slide in there because i &apos;m often asked if there are any animals in the project .
and what looks like two big hea@@ ps of leaves , is actually two single leaves that get shred@@ ded up by the har@@ sh desert conditions over time .
this bacteria was discovered several years ago by a team of planetary biologists hoping to find clu@@ es to life on other planets by looking at one of the har@@ sh@@ est conditions on ours .
it will be completely free , and it will work in any brow@@ ser .
i think pop@@ corn could change the way that we tell stories on the web , and the way we understand the world we live in .
consider the 2008 terrori@@ st attack on mumbai .
is he bal@@ d in front ? does he wear glasses ? &quot;
you could rob 200 people on a train , a great innovation .
you see , if you can print in metal , you can print one of these , and in fact you can also print one of these too .
and to ha@@ ckers , dna is just another operating system waiting to be ha@@ cked .
that &apos;s what i get asked all the time .
the threat is serious , and the time to prepare for it is now .
will i be mar@@ gin@@ alized ?
and when we think about legacy , i can think of no more powerful one , despite how short her life was .
and there is no group more vulnerable to those kinds of manipu@@ lations than young men .
i know it works .
who gets to use the mosqu@@ e on fri@@ days ? &quot;
and we placed him in a company in western kenya , just 200 miles away .
so , what do you think ?
and la@@ stly , the only portrait of a male that leonardo painted , &quot; the musician . &quot;
ladies and gentlemen , this story has not yet been published .
i don &apos;t know why . i did not ask for a con@@ dom .
then i used , tried to use the medical college girls .
what if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one ?
do your job simply , the girl will chase you .
every holi@@ day i had as a young boy was in a national park .
the passen@@ gers who fell off the titan@@ ic fell into water of just five degrees centi@@ grade .
i could barely breathe . i was gas@@ ping for air .
and after just three minutes in that water , he was able to get himself out .
and i remember looking into the ice , and there were big ch@@ un@@ ks of white ice in there , and the water was completely black .
l@@ p : i &apos;d just like to end off by just saying this : it took me four months again to feel my hands .
the talk will be broad@@ ly about energy , but oil &apos;s a good place to start .
and so , 25 years ago , there was a peak oil ; just like , in the 19@@ 20s , there was a peak coal ; and a hundred years before that , there was a peak wood .
it &apos;s not different , it &apos;s the same stuff : cal@@ ci@@ um carb@@ on@@ ate , cal@@ ci@@ um carb@@ on@@ ate .
it &apos;s not because we &apos;re going to build a ba@@ j@@ il@@ lion wind@@ mil@@ ls .
that &apos;s the one advantage that older people have .
and i said , &quot; i have no training as a doctor . i never cla@@ imed that . &quot;
and then she made me go up with the tape of it and prove that george ab@@ bot@@ t actually could talk .
and , inci@@ dentally , i call her the ele@@ an@@ or roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t of the right .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m learning . &quot;
his father was an so@@ b , and , in fact , he was another come@@ dian with an unhappy childhood , but then we were off and running .
an amazing woman .
first of all , was that dance , even though it hadn &apos;t been offered to her , was her life .
the problem is , without techn@@ icians , without spare parts , don@@ ations like this very quickly turn into junk .
michael free at path says you have to figure out who will &quot; choose , use and pay the du@@ es &quot; for a product like this .
you &apos;ve got to shine blue light on the kid -- bright blue light on as much of the skin as you can cover .
they &apos;re in@@ expensive , really ru@@ gged .
last story here : i &apos;ve got a friend in india who told me that you haven &apos;t really tested a piece of electronic technology for distribution in asia until you &apos;ve trained a cock@@ ro@@ ach to climb in and pe@@ e on every single little component on the inside .
one is the large global economy , the large glob@@ alized economy , and the other one is the small , and very limited , capacity of our traditional governments and their international institutions to gover@@ n , to shape , this economy .
we are not talking about 50,000 dollars here , or 100,000 dollars there , or one million dollars there .
well , thank you . i mean , it &apos;s interesting , in doing this , we had to sit together with the companies .
in germany , we have a system where you are not allowed to bri@@ be a civil ser@@ v@@ ant , but you are allowed to bri@@ be a de@@ pu@@ ty .
i &apos;m not connecting to them .
so i now have this sort of restaurant men@@ u visit@@ ing of art gall@@ eries .
and i thought , no , it &apos;s a very intimate look , but it &apos;s not a look a daughter gives her father .
amongst them a yellow coat with white fur , a yellow and black bo@@ di@@ ce , and you see these clothes on lots of other paintings , different women in the paintings , ver@@ me@@ er &apos;s paintings .
not the pain@@ ter , i don &apos;t want to think about the pain@@ ter .
i kept thinking of beds and red chee@@ ks , and of course i kept thinking of sex when i looked at him , and i thought , is that what he &apos;s thinking about ?
but it is difficult to hear the words al@@ ou@@ d .
there was hollywood .
so when i read in a newspaper in the business page the story of no@@ l@@ lywood , i really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story that goes against all these pre@@ concei@@ ved no@@ tions .
we &apos;re not doing films for the elite and the people in their glass houses .
it &apos;s all about the foreign movies .
move it .
the nigerian film@@ makers really , really , are doing what they like .
difficult , e@@ h ? it &apos;s meaning@@ less .
and we know that there are more .
z@@ ambi@@ a-@@ born filmmaker fran@@ co sac@@ ch@@ i t@@ ours us through no@@ l@@ lywood , nigeria &apos;s boom@@ ing film industry . gu@@ er@@ ri@@ l@@ la film@@ making and brilli@@ ance under pressure from cre@@ ws that can shoot a full-@@ length feature in a week .
we were talking about the ra@@ p@@ ture ? it &apos;s coming .
you know , we have to go through that .
it &apos;s about rolling a ball and picking up as many objects as you can in a fin@@ ite amount of time and hopefully you &apos;ll be able to make it into a planet .
so we have port@@ al because you shoot walls in order to create new spaces .
so time , space , a@@ esthe@@ tics , and then , most important , behavior .
so in a way , we &apos;re showing a manife@@ station of something that is truly important and that is part of our identity but that nobody can have .
i was concerned about making a place for the study of law .
i did this building in japan .
we made the drawings of the fish and the scales .
he was a sou@@ ven@@ ir sal@@ es@@ man who always wanted to be a pain@@ ter , and i was fran@@ kie p@@ . tor@@ onto .
and it seemed to work as a way to put he and i together .
and her@@ man mil@@ ler has this philosophy of having a place -- a people place .
and so then he put two bridges -- this all happened on the fa@@ x , going back and forth over a couple of weeks &apos; period .
they &apos;ve been building it so long i don &apos;t remember where it is .
we used it at lo@@ yo@@ la on the cha@@ pe@@ l , and it didn &apos;t work .
this is a piece of property in br@@ en@@ tw@@ ood .
and then you enter into the living room and then so on .
and you &apos;re looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of interaction between these pieces .
if any of you guys have any ideas for it , please contact me .
and i tried to -- there &apos;s a nick gri@@ m@@ sha@@ w building over here , there &apos;s an ol@@ den@@ burg sculpture over here -- i tried to make a relationship urban@@ is@@ tically .
the acou@@ stici@@ an in the competition gave us crit@@ eria , which led to this com@@ part@@ mental@@ ized sche@@ me , which we found out after the competition would not work at all .
and this is a te@@ apo@@ t i designed for al@@ ess@@ i .
it didn &apos;t work .
and so this is what they do .
so you start with the b@@ ag@@ as@@ se , and then you take a very simple kil@@ n that you can make out of a waste fif@@ ty five-@@ gall@@ on oil drum .
so we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger bri@@ qu@@ et@@ te so that we could compete with wood char@@ coal in the markets in haiti .
but this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits .
and we need to think about how we can do that effectively .
and this bone is pep@@ per@@ ed , as you can see , with the light shining through the skull with ca@@ vi@@ ties , the sin@@ uses , which warm and mo@@ i@@ st@@ en the air we breathe .
as you can see , it &apos;s blo@@ cking her vision .
that &apos;s exactly what people used to say to sue .
he main@@ tained a calm in@@ sou@@ ci@@ ance .
because you might say , &quot; well , this type of surgery might be regar@@ ded as cos@@ metic . &quot;
and beauty doesn &apos;t equ@@ ate to goo@@ dness , and certainly doesn &apos;t equ@@ ate to cont@@ ent@@ ment .
&quot; i want to look like this . this is how i looked before . &quot;
so the better news is the future &apos;s almost here -- and the future is tissue engineering .
how do we really change children &apos;s relationship to food ?
sev@@ enty percent of all antibiotics consumed in america is consumed in animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
it is about what we feed them .
why can we have 2@@ 9@@ -@@ cent big gul@@ ps and 9@@ 9@@ -@@ cent double bur@@ gers ?
we really need to change this whole paradigm with kids and food .
they do ta@@ st@@ ings of these ingredients in the garden@@ ing classes .
one of the things i do a lot is public@@ -@@ private partner@@ ships .
and , you know , i &apos;m not that better off now .
so we &apos;re spending less than a dollar , ok , on lunch .
and he pointed up to the sky , and he said , &quot; look , do you see that ?
when i go to a philosopher &apos;s party and they ask me what i work on and i say , &quot; consciousness , &quot; their eyes don &apos;t gla@@ ze over -- their li@@ ps cur@@ l into a s@@ nar@@ l .
that &apos;s the order of the day here .
this means that a lot of people are just left completely dis@@ satis@@ fied and incre@@ d@@ ulous when i attempt to explain consciousness .
i &apos;m working with a young compu@@ ter-@@ anim@@ ator docu@@ ment@@ arian named nick de@@ am@@ er , and this is a little demo that he &apos;s done for me , part of a larger project some of you may be interested in .
and i started across the hall in north carolina , because i thought it was probably a can@@ al@@ et@@ to , and would have all that in detail .
how many of you did it by rot@@ ating the one on the left in your mind &apos;s eye , to see if it matched up with the one on the right ?
if you &apos;re seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles , some black circles , there &apos;s another way of seeing it .
and keep going , until the subject pre@@ sses the button , saying , &quot; i see the change . &quot;
thanks very much for your attention .
they &apos;re basically attemp@@ ts at figuring out what people should do instead of rush hour car driving .
because you still have 80 percent of the traffic .
sev@@ enty percent of the population didn &apos;t want this .

what do we know about the country and the people that we pretend to protect , about the villages where the only one medicine to kill the pain and to stop the hunger is op@@ ium ?
you , yourself , will find yourself in a hospital bed -- or your mother , your child -- there are heads no@@ dding , people who say , &quot; yes , i know exactly what you mean . &quot;
well he also saw that when health care turns to medical care because of a more serious disease , the key thing that holds us back is access to information .
the question was , where from ?
where does medical ability end and start ?
it &apos;s really serious .
don &apos;t worry about the numbers .
there &apos;s a guy on twitter that i know , a health it guy outside boston , and he wrote the e-@@ patient ra@@ p .
and she saw that if there is no inf@@ la@@ m@@ mation then the scan is a uni@@ form gray .

and this , in terms of magne@@ si@@ um and the amount of water that i just mentioned , equ@@ ates to a $ 4@@ .@@ 5 billion mining industry for singa@@ pore -- a place that doesn &apos;t have any natural resources .
but one other extremely unique thing about bats is that they are able to use sound to perceive their environment . they use e@@ cho@@ location .
this is considered the five ble@@ s@@ sin@@ gs .
just have a quick look . and what we need to realize is that every 300 base pairs in your dna , you &apos;re a little bit different .
in europe alone , by 2050 , there is going to be a 70 percent increase of individuals over 65 , and 1@@ 70 percent increase in individuals over 80 .
em@@ ma te@@ eling : the secret of the bat genome
europe had to be dra@@ gged into economic development .
the opportunity we &apos;re going to look to is a genu@@ ine basis for optimism about the bottom billion , and that is the commodity bo@@ oms .
that is not a fore@@ cast about how commodity prices go ; it &apos;s a fore@@ cast of the consequences , the long-term consequences , for growth of an increase in prices .
it turns out that elec@@ tor@@ al competition is the thing that &apos;s doing the damage with democracy , whereas strong che@@ cks and bal@@ ances make resource bo@@ oms good .
they worked out they were worth two billion pounds .
paul colli@@ er : the &quot; bottom billion &quot;
all right , you &apos;ve all heard the term : &quot; he &apos;s a born surgeon . &quot;
so i was inspired by a friend .
so i &apos;m passionate about teaching these f@@ ls skills all over the world .
and we currently have access to ele@@ ven language pairs .
we need it for our everyday life , in order to make the world a smaller place .
i continued studying craft traditions and collabor@@ ating with arti@@ s@@ ans , next in li@@ thu@@ an@@ ia with l@@ ace makers .
my life was not going to be the same .
my artistic horiz@@ ons continue to grow .
it was 23 metric tons for one lit@@ er .
you could be attacked by white blood cells in the arter@@ ies .
they &apos;re learning to fle@@ x this system that rele@@ ases their own en@@ do@@ genous op@@ i@@ ates .
values are a certain kind of fact .
so the contribu@@ tions of culture -- if culture changes us , as indeed it does , it changes us by changing our brains .
well , consider by analogy , the concept of physical health .
the fact that there are ex@@ ceptions here does not change that at all .
this is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proli@@ fer@@ ation or poverty or any other hu@@ gely con@@ sequ@@ ential issue .
whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be exclu@@ ded .
sam har@@ ris : yeah , well i think i tried to bro@@ ach this in a sentence , watching the clock tic@@ king , but the question is : what is volun@@ tary in a context where men have certain expectations , and you &apos;re guaran@@ te@@ ed to be treated in a certain way if you don &apos;t ve@@ il yourself ?
sam har@@ ris : science can answer moral questions
here is a pest , devastating pest , a spider m@@ ite , because it does a lot of web@@ bing like a spider .
only the egg of the paras@@ ite will be in@@ ser@@ ted into the body flu@@ ids of the ap@@ hi@@ d .
everything is just fine under these circumstances .
and there goes the question , especially if you ask grow@@ ers , agri@@ cul@@ tu@@ rists : why biological control ?
step by step , it does narrow .
automo@@ tive retro@@ fu@@ tu@@ ris@@ m is one of my speci@@ al@@ ties .
this is tank pol@@ o in the south ha@@ mp@@ tons .
people wrote in for re@@ prints of that thing .
it was perfectly clear . i didn &apos;t do any thinking about it .
the third thing on my check@@ list is relations with neighbor@@ ing friendly societies that may pro@@ p up a society . and if that friendly support is pulled away , that may make a society more likely to collapse . in the case of the greenland nor@@ se , they had trade with the mother country -- nor@@ way -- and that trade d@@ wind@@ led : partly because nor@@ way got wea@@ ker , partly because of sea ice between greenland and nor@@ way .
so , some societies , for subtle environmental reasons , are more fragile than others . and then finally , another gener@@ alization . i &apos;m now teaching a course at uc@@ la , to uc@@ la under@@ gradu@@ ates , on these collap@@ ses of societies . what really bugs my uc@@ la under@@ graduate students is , how on earth did these societies not see what they were doing ?
instead , all the major threats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making . and since we made the problems , we can also solve the problems . that then means that it &apos;s entirely in our power to deal with these problems .
well we know that that was not a cheap war .
what are you eating ?
how are we going to feed this world ?
this has happened in the ne@@ therlands in the 1990s during the classical sw@@ ine fever out@@ break .
one kilo@@ gram of gra@@ s@@ shop@@ pers has the same amount of calories as 10 hot dogs , or six big mac@@ s .
so why are we not eating insects yet ?
look at them first . look at them first .
that means we get our new hi@@ ps for free .
in fact , when we &apos;re traveling ab@@ road , it &apos;s how we identify fellow canadi@@ ans .
i dra@@ ped them ca@@ sually over the chair in the doctor &apos;s office .
it was the world &apos;s first popular computer .
this is an astro@@ lab@@ e . pretty impressive , isn &apos;t it ?
so , it &apos;s about 26 degrees . you can &apos;t see it from over there .
it can be used for calcul@@ ating mathematical equations of all different types .
but what we lose , i think , is an accurate -- a felt sense of the sky , a sense of context .
you &apos;re using your buil@@ t-@@ in dynamics , the physics of your body , just like a pen@@ dul@@ um .
let me demonstrate how it works .
and they already had a six leg@@ ged robot called le@@ mu@@ r .
instead of using electrical motors , electro@@ mechanical ac@@ tu@@ ators , we &apos;re using com@@ pressed air .
for those who probably know , if you don &apos;t have any sensors and there are any distur@@ ban@@ ces , you know what happens .
what you see over here , this is the beautiful lou@@ is v@@ u@@ it@@ ton cup tro@@ ph@@ y .
and they assemble , and they form these kinds of mechanisms .
there was a great ted moment , i think it was sir ken ro@@ bin@@ son , was it ?
it &apos;s a story of public education and of rural communities and of what design might do to improve both .
the biggest emplo@@ yer is the pur@@ due chicken processing plant .
specifically , we use these six design dire@@ ctives , probably the most important being number two : we design with , not for -- in that , when we &apos;re doing human@@ it@@ ari@@ an-@@ focused design , it &apos;s not about designing for clients anymore .
it &apos;s the physical construction of improved spaces and materials and experiences for teachers and students .
so in many cases this is not so much about making change as it is creating the conditions under which change is possible and the incentive to want to make change , which is easier said than done in rural communities and in insi@@ de-@@ the-@@ box education systems in rural communities .
and during that time , they &apos;re doing everything from going out and doing eth@@ no@@ graphic research and doing the nee@@ d-@@ finding , coming back into the studio , doing the brain@@ stor@@ ming and design visualization to come up with concepts that might work , and then moving into the shop and actually testing them , building them , prototy@@ ping them , figuring out if they are going to work and re@@ fin@@ ing that .
but we feel like this could work in other places .
generally , what you see in green is not deser@@ ti@@ fying , and what you see in brown is , and these are by far the greatest areas of the earth .
now , that was a terrible decision for me to have to make , and it was political dynam@@ ite , frankly .
it has just come through four months of rain , and it &apos;s now going into eight months of dry season .
but we biologists and eco@@ logists had never tack@@ led anything as complex as this .
they put 25,000 sheep in one flo@@ ck , really mi@@ mic@@ king nature now with planned gra@@ zing , and they have documented a 50-@@ percent increase in the production of the land in the first year .
thank you so mu@@ ch@@ .@@ as : well , thank you . thank you . thank you , chris .
and these two missions , as you can tell , th@@ read together perfectly . one ad@@ ds to the other ; in fact , one would be impossible without the other .
after treatment , the child gains significant func@@ tion@@ ality .
if you show him real world images , if you show others like him real world images , they are unable to recognize most of the objects because the world to them is over-@@ fra@@ gmented ; it &apos;s made up of a col@@ la@@ ge , a pat@@ ch@@ work , of regions of different colors and lu@@ min@@ ances .
ps : and we see this pattern over and over again .
how does that happen ? we want dy@@ lan to be able to do that , and using this man@@ tra of motion , dy@@ lan actually can do that .
sher@@ y@@ l sha@@ de : hi , ai@@ me@@ e . ai@@ me@@ e mul@@ lin@@ s : hi .

and he said , &quot; no , no , really . you can .
it &apos;s now two years that you &apos;ve been running ?
i tried to get it out of anybody i could , you know , &quot; who am i running against here ? &quot;
if i had won everything -- but it was like , what was the point ?
i &apos;m like , &quot; get it off ! don &apos;t worry about it , you know .
i need to get some new ones because the last meet i was at , they were everywhere . you know , it &apos;s like a big -- it &apos;s come full circle .
and she came into town and she ru@@ shed around and she said , &quot; i have to buy some new shoes ! &quot;
now this is obviously a powerful , some might say danger@@ ously powerful , insight .
some people think this number &apos;s a little bit large , but copyright mathematicians who are media lo@@ bby experts are merely surprised that it doesn &apos;t get com@@ poun@@ ded for inf@@ lation every year .
see , in the real world math isn &apos;t necessarily done by mathematicians .
once you &apos;ve done that , then there &apos;s the computation step .
i estimated that , just today , across the world , we spent about 10@@ 6 average world life@@ times teaching people how to calculate by hand .
so my usual question is , what do you mean by &quot; ba@@ sics ? &quot;
i don &apos;t think so .
but there &apos;s a fantastic way to do that in the modern world .
and of course , it turns into a circle .
and you know if you walk across a cha@@ sm , you end up making it worse than if you didn &apos;t start at all -- bigger disaster .
its le@@ ash had been tied to the chair as her master went in for coffee , and she was just persist@@ ent in her efforts to gre@@ et me , perhaps get a scratch behind the ear .

and i see my life as a series of experiments .
as i say in my book , i &apos;m jewish in the same way the o@@ live garden is italian .
so , certainly the challenge was there .
so , i was able to stone one adul@@ ter@@ er .
but this one is -- the bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month , and more than that , you cannot sit on a seat where a men@@ stru@@ ating woman has sat .
this was one of the great things about my year , doing the sab@@ bath , because i am a work@@ a@@ ho@@ lic , so having this one day where you cannot work , it really , that changed my life .
and they said , &quot; we don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s just rituals that give us meaning . &quot;
so , anyway , thank you so much for letting me speak .
the problem , as we see it , has to do with a single , simple word : &quot; space , &quot; or a single , simple phrase : &quot; real world geometry . &quot;
but if you disp@@ la@@ yed that on a cr@@ t or flat panel display , it would be meaning@@ less to hold up an ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ary object , a real world object in that .
so this led full circle , in a strange way , to build these ideas into what we believe is the necessary future of human machine interface : the spa@@ tial operating environment , we call it .
there &apos;re a lot of elements .
so collaborative work , whether it &apos;s immediately co-@@ located or distant and distinct , is always important .
can it be for every man , or is this just for corporations and movie producers ?

someone who has done something like this , however medi@@ oc@@ re and thro@@ wa@@ way , has tried something , has put something forward in public .
but the group of day@@ care centers represented by the black line , they said , &quot; we are changing this bar@@ gain as of right now .
here is the critical difference between these : lo@@ l@@ cats is commun@@ al value .
and may it run forever , because it gives people like me a living .
or you could play many games in one small pat@@ ch of land , even if you didn &apos;t know which game you were actually in .
england invented 20 over@@ s cricket , and said , &quot; the world must play 20 over@@ s cricket . &quot;
six weeks , city versus city .
but what they were very good at doing was making it very loc@@ alized .
we started getting song and dance in indian cricket .
sh@@ an@@ e war@@ ne sold for 4@@ 50,000 dollars .
can you imagine , you &apos;ve got the dollar on view and there &apos;s no delhi belly in there anymore .
there are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide what the right thing is to do , and those are errors in estimat@@ ing the odds that they &apos;re going to succeed , and errors in estimat@@ ing the value of their own success .
now , you see a very interesting pattern here , which is first of all , two things are va@@ stly over-@@ estimated , namely tor@@ na@@ does and fire@@ works .
and most people say , &quot; ok , i &apos;ll play . &quot;
when people are asked about these two different jobs : a job where you make 6@@ 0@@ k , then 50@@ k , then 40@@ k , a job where you &apos;re getting a sal@@ ary cut each year , and one in which you &apos;re getting a sal@@ ary increase , people like the second job better than the first , despite the fact they &apos;re all told they make much less money . why ?
along the way , you lost something .
for some of the subjects , sitting in the far corner of a room is a box of go@@ di@@ va chocol@@ ates , and for others is a can of sp@@ am .
if you &apos;re an american , for example , you &apos;ve probably traveled in france .
that is , they require interest rates in the hundred or thousands of per@@ cents in order to del@@ ay gra@@ tification and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars .
people always think more is better than less : 60 is always better than 50 , and they always think now is better than later : the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side .
surely the kinds of play that at least american media give to -- and for@@ give me , but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents .
but is there a rational fear that actually , the reason we &apos;re frighten@@ ed about this is because we think that the big one is to come ?
so , you know , when a school bus is blown up and we &apos;ve never seen this before , our general tendency is to ori@@ ent towards that which is new and novel is activated .
ad@@ g : in persu@@ ading them .
he apparently lost an eye in battle , which is why he is always shown in profile .
so , it was going nowhere .
this one generates no imagery at all . &quot;
that can be a big contribution .
the phrase &apos; art is whatever &apos; ex@@ pre@@ sses the current inclu@@ si@@ veness that surr@@ ounds ar@@ t-@@ making -- a sort of &apos; it ain &apos;t what you do , it &apos;s the way that you do it &apos; notion .
so by and large , they are good for our survival .
the philosopher mar@@ th@@ a n@@ us@@ s@@ b@@ au@@ m points this out in this quote : &quot; thus throughout history , certain disgust properties -- sli@@ min@@ ess , bad smell , sti@@ c@@ kin@@ ess , deca@@ y , f@@ ou@@ l@@ ness -- have been repe@@ ate@@ dly and mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ously been associated with ...
when we actually looked at not just self-@@ reported political ori@@ entation , but voting behavior , we were able to look geo@@ graph@@ ically across the nation . what we found was that in regions in which people reported high levels of disgust sensi@@ tivity , mc@@ ca@@ in got more vot@@ es .
it makes less sense that an emotion that was built to prevent me from in@@ ge@@ sting poison should predict who i &apos;m going to vote for in the up@@ coming presi@@ dential election .
wish i could .
mar@@ cus : and how many soldiers have you recru@@ ited to fight this war with you ?

we don &apos;t need no more trouble no more trouble we don &apos;t need no more trouble no more trouble . wake up ! everybody wake up . road block !
why ? because you want our diam@@ ond .
n thank you .
or we can zoom out to the table of cont@@ ents , and the video keeps playing .
all right . mike , thanks so much .
a lot of us work for people ; we &apos;re in the hands of other people .
so where do we go now ?
september 11 generated some interest in moving it over to ground zero , and i &apos;m totally against that .
i tried to understand that language as a beginning , as a place to jump off , and there was so much of it being done by spe@@ c buil@@ ders and it was tri@@ vi@@ alized so much that it wasn &apos;t ...
f@@ g : i don &apos;t know .
i was so proud .
and i think that &apos;s what i &apos;ve always been interested in , is that -- which is a personal kind of expression .
it was a table as long as this carpet and the harbor com@@ mission@@ er was here , and i was here , and my guys .
frank ge@@ h@@ ry : a master architect asks , now what ?
totally transformed by man .
these things that i photographed -- this ti@@ re pile here had 45 million ti@@ res in it . it was the largest one .
and for me china -- i started photograph@@ ing it four years ago , and china truly is a question of sustainability in my mind , not to mention that china , as well , has a great effect on the industries that i grew up around .
this is w@@ us@@ han , one of the largest cities that was re@@ located .
what &apos;s also happening in shanghai is -- china is changing because this wouldn &apos;t have happened five years ago , for instance . this is a hol@@ d@@ out .
and i &apos;m sure there are people here who probably know better than i do about effici@@ encies , but i can &apos;t imagine that every apartment having its own air condi@@ tion@@ er is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale .
they were just w@@ ound up doing these things all day long , until the man@@ ager had to , with a stern voice , say , &quot; okay , everybody free@@ ze . &quot;
this was one of the biggest factories i &apos;ve ever seen .
and as much as there are great things around the corner -- and it &apos;s pal@@ p@@ able in this room -- of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems , i &apos;m really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect .
and anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic .
and the scale of my work , and the kinds of ideas i &apos;m playing with -- when i first saw an ima@@ x film , i almost immediately thought , &quot; there &apos;s a real reson@@ ance between what i &apos;m trying to do and the scale of what i try to do as a photographer . &quot;
and the reason we see mines is because there &apos;s a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place .
plastics have over@@ la@@ pping den@@ sities over a very narrow range .
and we eventually broke the code .
we take out the things that aren &apos;t plastics , such as the metals they missed , car@@ pe@@ ting , fo@@ am , rubber , wood , glass , paper , you name it .
and finally , i hope you agree with me to change that last to@@ dd@@ ler rule just a little bit to : &quot; if it &apos;s broken , it &apos;s my stuff . &quot;
you know , we &apos;re the smar@@ test thing out there , why can &apos;t we figure this out ?
you know , so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant , but al@@ be@@ it evolutionary , relative .
but this is the unit of currency that we &apos;ve taught our monkeys at y@@ ale to actually use with humans , to actually buy different pieces of food .
well , you might actually imagine them to do all the kinds of smart things that humans do when they start ex@@ changing money with each other .
the more surprising thing was that when we collabor@@ ated with economists to actually look at the monkeys &apos; data using economic tools , they basically matched , not just qu@@ al@@ it@@ a@@ tively , but quanti@@ ta@@ tively with what we saw humans doing in a real market .
your other option is a bit safe . your just going to get some money for sure .
so what &apos;s going on ?
the guy on the left is a safe bon@@ us .
again , same choice ; they can play it safe for always getting two gra@@ pes every single time , or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three .
well , one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome .
thank you .
and i feel that way because three billion people in the world today , over the next 20 years , will need a new home .
that &apos;s the change .
the engineering is , tru@@ th@@ fully , the easy part of this .
bomb b@@ last cur@@ tains covered my windows .
think about it : what other business do you know , what other sector of the economy , and especially one as big as the public sector , that doesn &apos;t seek to re@@ invent its business model on a regular basis ?
no one is better at this activity of actually getting us to engage in deli@@ vering services , sometimes where none exist , than us@@ ha@@ hi@@ di .
let me be very clear , and perhaps controversial , that open government is not about transparent government .
we don &apos;t have words , really , to describe it yet .
in fact , she indi@@ cated that if we would do that , not only would we have the joy of receiving the gra@@ titude from the members of the extended family , but she said , &quot; even god will smile , and when god s@@ miles , there is peace , and justice , and joy . &quot;
and , like chief seattle said , &quot; we did not spin the web of life .
and he said , &quot; i hope that you will have the strength to do what i did .
and , according to jesus , the word comes forth , &quot; you must love yourself , you must love the lord your god with all your heart , mind and soul , and your neighbor as yourself . &quot;
i close with this song -- it &apos;s a children &apos;s song -- because we are all children at the table of ma@@ ma e@@ ternal .
the vietnam prote@@ sts , the com@@ memor@@ ation of all that died in the pandemic of aids , the march for women &apos;s re@@ productive rights , right up until almost the present .
one re@@ dee@@ ming feature is it &apos;s lifted up off the ground and it &apos;s got this vo@@ id , and it &apos;s got an empty core kind of in the spirit and that fa@@ ca@@ de very much corporate and federal style .
and it has to be free .
that &apos;s the pan@@ the@@ on next to it .
this is the war@@ p and we@@ ft .
so i have bran@@ ded myself as a war child .
what was actually killing us wasn &apos;t the muslims , wasn &apos;t the arab@@ s .
sometimes you gotta lose to win .
don &apos;t even know the day i &apos;ll ever return .
and one thing that shocked me is one day they brought an arab musician to come and enter@@ tain the soldiers .
but that moved me .
well now , my time is going , so i want to sing a song .
he never knew his father very well , because his father left his mom while she was pregnant with him .
some of these lawyers were successful ; they managed to get new trials for their clients .
all that i want to tell you is that the reason that this has happened is because death pen@@ alty lawyers have understood that the earlier you interven@@ e in a case , the greater the likelihood that you &apos;re going to save your client &apos;s life .
what we &apos;re talking about today is just as complicated .
now , it was logi@@ sti@@ cally difficult .
i hope there &apos;s one thing you all won &apos;t forget : in between the time you arrived here this morning and the time we break for lunch , there are going to be four hom@@ ici@@ des in the united states .
i mean , santa cla@@ us knows if you &apos;re n@@ augh@@ ty or nice , right ? &quot;
september 10 is not your birthday . it &apos;s october 10 . &quot; and i said , &quot; what ? &quot;
now , i was raised in the pacific nor@@ thwest , around a lot of church of lat@@ ter-@@ day sa@@ ints people and , you know , i &apos;ve worked with them and even dated them , but i never really knew the do@@ c@@ tr@@ ine or what they said to people when they were out on a mission , and i guess i was , sort of , curious , so i said , &quot; well , please , come in . &quot; and they looked really happy , because i don &apos;t think this happens to them all that often .
i said , &quot; what happened to the la@@ man@@ ites ? &quot;
what if you had a nose job and you liked it ?
we have focused on the problems .
i believe , if ken@@ ne@@ dy was alive today , he would be asking statisti@@ ci@@ ans such as myself to go out and find out what makes life worth@@ while .
when it has a scar@@ ce resource that it wants to turn into a desi@@ r@@ able outcome , it thinks in terms of efficiency .
the country on its own up at the top is a place i haven &apos;t been to .
that &apos;s one way of looking at it .
and that means we have to really increase efficiency even more .
do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do , and energy ?
they don &apos;t need a lot of material goods to be satis@@ fied .
what turned out to determine whether someone would stop and help a stran@@ ger in need was how much of a hur@@ ry they thought they were in -- were they feeling they were late , or were they absor@@ bed in what they were going to talk about .
now this is a -- it &apos;s a little test i encourage you to try out at a party .
right now , as bill mcdon@@ ough has pointed out , the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences .
the moment i stopped , half a dozen other people immediately rin@@ ged the same guy .
i realized then that i , who thought i had complete control of my life , had control of only three things : my thought , my mind -- the images that these thoughts created -- and the action that deri@@ ved from it .
i needed something to go that extra mile , and i found it in that metaphor which i had learned from my mother when i was four .
an@@ anda sh@@ an@@ k@@ ar ja@@ y@@ ant : fighting cancer with dance
but in general it was difficult -- it was really difficult to explain what the web was like .
what do you mean , &quot; data &quot; ? what &apos;s the difference -- documents , data ?
data is relationships .
let &apos;s think about data for a bit .
audience : raw .
now if i go on like this , you &apos;ll think that all the data comes from huge institutions and has nothing to do with you .
you may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it .
all together , they achieved these results : increased the number of people on anti-@@ retro@@ vir@@ als , life-@@ saving anti-@@ aids drugs ; nearly hal@@ ved deaths from malaria ; vaccin@@ ated so many that 5@@ .@@ 4 million lives will be saved .
now here , we see the role for an unprecedented co@@ ali@@ tion of social media gi@@ ants and up@@ starts , tele@@ com@@ s companies , reality tv show for@@ mat@@ s , gam@@ ing companies , tele@@ com@@ s , all of them together in kind of their &quot; we are the world &quot; moment .
it &apos;s getting near zero .
thank you , thank you .
and he said , &quot; oh , i teach at a college of arts .
so i just thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to capture thu@@ mb@@ print , footprint , or whatever traces we leave as humans . &quot;
if we ask einstein , he would say , &quot; whether the cow crossed the road , or the road moved underneath the cow , depends on your frame of reference . &quot;
again , &quot; in@@ ward out . &quot;
and this was collected by an@@ a@@ pu@@ m -- which is like , finally in the end , he will not have anything , because it will eva@@ por@@ ate .
this gave me a greater faith .
you can see the detail .
i &apos;m a little bit of an amate@@ ur histor@@ ian , so i &apos;ve spent some time going back , trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing . and the best , earliest quote that i could find was one from david li@@ v@@ ing@@ stone , writing in the 18@@ 50s about how the rail@@ road , the steam ship , and the tele@@ graph were integr@@ ating east africa perfectly with the rest of the world .
so it &apos;s very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that i talk about in my book , &quot; world 3.@@ 0 , &quot; that we &apos;re very , very far from the no-@@ border effect ben@@ ch@@ mark , which would imp@@ ly inter@@ nation@@ alization levels of the order of 85 , 90 , 95 percent .
the perspective was , here is this poor professor .
think of france and the current debate about im@@ migration .
at the same time , i was thinking , well , there &apos;s lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products , away from the ethnic , a little bit more contemporary .
but if we re@@ ar@@ range this formula quickly , we can get to acceler@@ ation equ@@ als force over mass , which means that for a larger particle -- a larger mass -- it requires more force to change its direction .
the marketing is -- the message for marketing is -- that try to measure what consumers actually do , rather than what they say they &apos;ll do or anticip@@ ate they &apos;ll do .
your brand starts being disper@@ sed , it gets more cha@@ otic .
and the third string is pretty innovative .
so , for example , you can be a pit@@ cher or a cat@@ cher , and that correspon@@ ds to whether you perform a sexual act or receive a sexual act .
can you imagine saying to your coach , &quot; u@@ h , i &apos;m not really feeling it today , i think i &apos;ll sit this game out . &quot;
&quot; well , maybe we can go half and half . &quot;
and sometimes that can be different amounts over different times or with different people or on different days .
&quot; what &apos; tis to love ? &quot; shakespeare said .
real dependence on this person .
i was just st@@ agger@@ ed by it .
and i think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there , looking for a whole range of partners .
in short , they are ac@@ quir@@ ing the status that they had a million years ago , 10,000 years ago , 100,000 years ago .
it &apos;s one of many , many characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market .
we &apos;re also re@@ turning to an ancient form of marriage equality .
this is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you &apos;ve made love to them .
dopamine is associated with romantic love .
but i want to tell you a story about -- to illustrate .
and everybody there agreed this woman was very sick and she needed to be in the hospital .
i actually just as@@ sm@@ ed the patho@@ logic sequence of events was sett@@ led science .
in fact , what if it &apos;s a symp@@ tom of a much deeper problem , the tip of a pro@@ ver@@ bial ice@@ berg ?
now i don &apos;t know why , but it might be because , in their case , their cells haven &apos;t actually figured out the right thing to do with that ex@@ cess energy .
but this team of multi-@@ discipl@@ inary , highly skep@@ tical and exce@@ e@@ din@@ gly talented researchers do agree on two things .
peter at@@ tia : is the obesity crisis hiding a bigger problem ?
so when i was born , i guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me .
i mean , i think most people in the industry understand that we &apos;ve got to get on with it .
frankly , four billion clean cars on the road are still four billion cars , and a traffic j@@ am with no emissions is still a traffic j@@ am .
now shared car services are also sp@@ r@@ inging up around the world , and these efforts , i think , are great .
we need that same kind of passion and energy to attack global gri@@ d@@ lock .
charlie le@@ d@@ better , yesterday , i thought , talked very artic@@ ul@@ ately about this need to bring consumers , to bring people into the process of creating things .
so they sna@@ pped into action .
george de me@@ str@@ al -- this is not bugs all over a bir@@ ken@@ stock -- was walking his dog in a field and got covered in bur@@ r@@ s , sort of little pri@@ ck@@ ly things , and from that came vel@@ cr@@ o .
it &apos;s been all about these kind of thou@@ ght@@ less things that people do , which have huge intention and huge opportunity .
i talk about un@@ thinking situations all the time .
so , again , we were asked to design a water pump for a company called ap@@ prote@@ c , in kenya .
contagi@@ ous is a good word .
and in two hours , after their backs were broke , they were changed .
they are sk@@ ating . they are doing street plays .
k first time , a r@@ ally and a street play in a rural school -- un@@ heard of -- to tell their parents why literacy is important .
so , today who is it going to take to spread the infection from 100,000 children to the 200 million children in india ?
and interestingly , as i think back , they were the first true environ@@ mental@@ ists .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not the answer .
if i pull back from that global picture , and i look at the impli@@ cation over a similar period of time in terms of the technology -- which , as a tool , is a tool for designers , and i c@@ ite our own experience as a company , and i just illustrate that by a small selection of projects -- then how do you measure that change of technology ?
round about that design period leading up to this building , i did a ske@@ tch , which we pulled out of the archi@@ ve recently .
so for example , we would put models under an artificial sky .
so really , re@@ transl@@ ating that technology and developing something which was so clean , it was virtually pollu@@ tion-@@ free .
so there has been a project which resc@@ ues the dead sea by creating a pipeline , a pipe , sometimes above the surface , sometimes buried , that will re@@ dress that , and will feed from the gulf of a@@ q@@ ab@@ a into the dead sea .
it &apos;s more than one device , you know , it &apos;s renewable .
and here you can see how they really cra@@ fted a beautiful design process with physical models , with quanti@@ tative , as well as qu@@ al@@ it@@ ative , methods to come to a final solution that is truly integrated and completely holi@@ stic with the architecture .
to me it is something from the@@ at@@ re , and i will get back to that a little bit later .
so light is , of course , for social interaction also -- to create relationships with all the features around us .
and we can actually leave it out where it &apos;s not needed at all and where we can preserve darkness .
can we be more gent@@ le with light ?
in architecture , it works just the same .
is it that i write very well ?
the research gu@@ ide@@ lines of u.s. national academy of sciences or research coun@@ c@@ ils of the u.k .
if this woman has to carry water on her head for miles and miles and miles , you cannot be celebr@@ ating that .
they could be creative in terms of education , they may be creative in terms of culture , they may be creative in terms of institutions ; but a lot of our work is in the field of technological creativity , the innovations , either in terms of contemporary innovations , or in terms of traditional knowledge .
obviously she &apos;s an artist ; she &apos;s a creative person .
you bring your water , you bring your soap , i wash the clothes for you . charge 50 pa@@ is@@ a , one ru@@ pe@@ e for you per lot , and a new business model can emerge .
higher the local fit , greater is the chance of scaling up .
my technology .
we were talking about , my friends in brazil , how we scale up this model in china and brazil .
she said , &quot; change your profession . &quot;
then you don &apos;t need anything to control the car , except thinking about it .
500 years ago , sa@@ iling ships started getting reliable enough ; we found a new continent .
or s@@ now@@ mo@@ bil@@ es . you don &apos;t need the snow .
and they belong on the side@@ walks , and they &apos;ll use it seriously . &quot;
so , having seen this , and having worried about it for eight years , the first thing i do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regul@@ atory guys , call a@@ ar@@ p , get an ap@@ poin@@ tment right away .
we &apos;ve been working on this , actually , as an alternative energy source , starting way back with johnson &amp; amp ; johnson , to run an i@@ bo@@ t , because the best batteries you could get -- 10 wat@@ t-@@ hours per kilo@@ gram in lead , 20 wat@@ t-@@ hours per kilo@@ gram nic@@ kel@@ -@@ ca@@ d@@ mi@@ um , 40 wat@@ t-@@ hours per kilo@@ gram in nic@@ kel@@ -@@ metal hy@@ dri@@ de , 60 wat@@ t-@@ hours per kilo@@ gram in lith@@ ium , 8@@ ,@@ 7@@ 50 wat@@ t-@@ hours of energy in every kilo@@ gram of pro@@ pan@@ e or gasoline -- which is why nobody drives electric cars .
animal fan ne@@ lli@@ e m@@ ck@@ ay sin@@ gs a spar@@ k@@ ling tribu@@ te to her dear dog . she suggests we all do the same : &quot; just go right to the pound / and find yourself a h@@ ound / and make that do@@ g@@ gie proud / &apos; cause that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about . &quot;
however , while it &apos;s easier to think of us , the citizens , the police , the army , as the good guys , and them , the nar@@ co@@ s , the car@@ tel@@ es , as the bad guys , if you think about it , the lat@@ ter are only providing a service to the former .
but this is the result of a very careful br@@ anding and business strategy .
they have actually re@@ tained access to the profitable drug trade , but the way they do it is , because they control all of mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ á@@ n , and they control the port of l@@ á@@ zar@@ o c@@ á@@ r@@ den@@ as , they leverage that to , for example , trade copper from mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ á@@ n that is leg@@ ally created and leg@@ ally extrac@@ ted with illegal e@@ phe@@ dr@@ ine from china which is a critical pre@@ cur@@ sor for meth@@ am@@ phe@@ ta@@ mines that they produce , and then they have partner@@ ships with larger organizations like the sin@@ alo@@ a feder@@ ation that place their products in the u.s .
and so to me the question is not whether these dynamics will continue the way they have .
and then it &apos;s time to do it again . last year .
the next phase it hit was dis@@ plac@@ ement .
here &apos;s another technology that &apos;s approaching a critical price .
you can have re@@ gener@@ ative bra@@ king ; you can have dri@@ ve-@@ by-@@ wire ; you can have replac@@ e@@ able body shapes -- it &apos;s a little thing that starts with a hybri@@ d , but it can lead to a whole new era of the car .
and what &apos;s interesting is that it was just 1990 when it was more than two dollars a minute .
they use mo@@ but@@ u as metaphor .
i want to share one story about an innovation called dri@@ p ir@@ ri@@ gation .
and so we met dr. son@@ o k@@ han@@ gh@@ ar@@ an@@ i in pakistan .
but again i would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things to happen .
and for the first time ever in three generations , his children would go to school .
thank you .
you have my friend , who has a blog on digital -- on p@@ dr@@ s , personal recor@@ ders .
i like music , and i like ban@@ jo@@ s , and i think i probably heard steve martin playing , and i said , &quot; i could do that . &quot;
i wrote this one , and i put this up because of einstein today .
and you see this post .
i showed a nor@@ man ro@@ ck@@ well painting before , and this one i grew up with , looking at constantly .
i put the bad pictures up too , because there are bad pictures .
they &apos;re the largest of the tun@@ as , the secon@@ d-@@ largest fish in the sea -- bon@@ y fish .
the european population and north african -- the eastern blu@@ ef@@ in tuna -- is fi@@ shed at tremendous levels : 50,000 tons over the last decade almost every year .
we basically are taking the same satellite phone parts , or the same parts that are in your computer , chips .
now , the activities from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean .
there are two villages , har@@ ris and mo@@ re@@ head city , every winter for over a decade , held a party called ta@@ g-@@ a-@@ giant , and together , fish@@ ers worked with us to tag 800 to 9@@ 00 fish .
these become for@@ th@@ right in places we need to protect .
the tuna team from top@@ p has done the un@@ thin@@ kable : three teams tagged 1,@@ 700 tun@@ as , blu@@ ef@@ in , yel@@ low@@ f@@ in and al@@ bac@@ ore all at the same time -- carefully re@@ hear@@ sed ta@@ gging programs in which we go out , pick up juven@@ ile tun@@ as , put in the tags that actually have the sensors , stick out the tuna and then let them go .
we did this with the great tur@@ tle race -- tagged tur@@ tles , brought in four million hits .
hi there . i &apos;m ha@@ san . i &apos;m an artist .
and he looks at me really confused and says , &quot; no explo@@ si@@ ves ? &quot;
and i was like , &quot; all we need is al@@ as@@ ka not to get the last me@@ mo , and here we go all over again . &quot;
this was on del@@ ta 7@@ 19 going from j@@ f@@ k to san francisco .
all of these are extrac@@ ted directly from my bank accounts , and everything po@@ ps up right away .
and on sunday , june 14@@ th at 2009 -- this was actually about two o &apos;clock in the afternoon in sk@@ o@@ whe@@ gan , ma@@ ine -- this was my apartment there .
because no one &apos;s really watching .
he : well it goes to the last point that i was at .
and now , 2012 .
now , four years ago , chris lost his job , unfortunately , as an art bu@@ yer at m@@ acy &apos;s , and like so many people , he stru@@ gg@@ led to find a new one during the recession .
how do we mimic the way trust is built fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face online ?
it was ridiculous . i couldn &apos;t get a mobile phone plan because my credit history didn &apos;t travel with me .
now the interesting thing is , reputation is the soci@@ o@@ economic lu@@ bri@@ c@@ ant that makes collaborative consumption work and scale , but the sources it will be generated from , and its applications , are far bigger than this space alone .
there &apos;s been an explosion of collaborative consumption -- web@@ -@@ powered sharing of cars , apartments , skills . rac@@ he@@ l bot@@ s@@ man explo@@ res the currency that makes systems like air@@ b@@ n@@ b and tas@@ k@@ rab@@ bit work : trust , influence , and what she calls &quot; reputation capital . &quot;
now i &apos;m going to show you what that does to our societies .
it &apos;s simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted .
but it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison .
the position of women , how closely they keep to the nuclear family , are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world .
but i should say a few words about what &apos;s going on .
and of course , others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on .
one of the key areas we &apos;ve been working on recently is medical devices , and while it may not be obvious that medical devices have something in common with iraq &apos;s electricity grid then , there are some common@@ alities .
how do you ensure it gets to them and it impro@@ ves their lives ?
notice anything about it ?
the industry average is about 65 percent .
you &apos;ve got to pay for your soap , your de@@ od@@ or@@ ant , to@@ oth@@ brush , to@@ oth@@ paste , all of it .
the best thing we can do is figure out ways to nur@@ ture the entreprene@@ uri@@ al spirit and the tremendous un@@ ta@@ pped potential in our pri@@ sons , because if we don &apos;t , they &apos;re not going to learn any new skills that &apos;s going to help them , and they &apos;ll be right back .
second of all , it &apos;s really beautifully bal@@ anced : it holds well , it feels well .
now , the weird thing is google lies , because if i type &quot; design and emotion , &quot; it says , &quot; you don &apos;t need the &apos; and . &apos; we do it anyway . &quot;
now some people can -- cir@@ cus workers , steel workers .
no big deal .
and behavioral design is all about feeling in control , which includes us@@ ability , understanding -- but also the feel and he@@ ft .
it &apos;s kind of neat . what a wonderful design .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s nice about emotion .
but it was quite obvious , quite clear , that for this particular route that i had taken , the remot@@ er the school was , the worse its results seemed to be .
anyway , so i &apos;m propos@@ ing that an alternative primary education , whatever alternative you want , is required where schools don &apos;t exist , where schools are not good enough , where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough , for whatever reason .
so he figured that out . it took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television .
so they said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve left this machine which talks only in english , so we had to learn english . &quot;
what could they learn to do ?
a typical example being , &quot; sometimes it is necessary to tell lies . &quot;
thank you .
and i , one day , i announced this to my parents -- and my father den@@ ies this story to this day -- i said , &quot; d@@ addy , i want to be a diplom@@ at . &quot;
and anyway , my tour -- it was kind of a very exciting time .
secondly , the government had ignored all available alter@@ natives to war , which in some ways was a more dis@@ cred@@ itable thing still .
my pen@@ sion was in it .
why don &apos;t you advi@@ se their government on their diplomacy ? &quot;
and one thing led to another , and i ended up having a desk in ? what if ! in new york , when i started independent diplom@@ at .
what this means is it &apos;s no longer good enough to say that international relations , or global aff@@ air@@ s , or chaos in som@@ alia , or what &apos;s going on in bur@@ ma is none of your business , and that you can leave it to governments to get on with .
and of course , everybody got it . everybody went , &quot; yes , of course , you &apos;re absolutely right .
it &apos;s that broken experience on the web .
so where this comes into play and why this is important is i head up a technology incu@@ b@@ ator , and we had eight star@@ tu@@ ps sitting around there .
so most everyone wat@@ ches tv .
animals might love to play , but they don &apos;t love to watch .
as we start , you see in 1960 inspiration is holding stea@@ dy .
look at this green spi@@ ke in 196@@ 6 to a bel@@ l@@ we@@ ther show .
glamorous and rich .
that &apos;s all great , right ?
and then she clar@@ i@@ fied . she said , &quot; you know what , i don &apos;t mean that it suc@@ ks . it means that i didn &apos;t understand a word of it .
because , you see , dna is like a blue@@ print that tells living things what to make .
it kills me . i &apos;m not kid@@ ding .
or even worse , science education is becoming like that guy who always says , &quot; actually . &quot;
there &apos;s still so much work left to be done , though , and if you &apos;re involved with science in any way i urge you to join me .
but sometimes it &apos;s as though a door@@ way appears from out of nowhere and it opens onto a stair@@ case .
but here &apos;s the weir@@ dest place of all : war .
dur@@ k@@ he@@ im called this level the level of the sacred because he believed that the function of religion was to un@@ ite people into a group , into a moral community .
he said , &quot; if the one tribe included a great number of coura@@ geous , sym@@ pa@@ thetic and fai@@ th@@ ful members who are always ready to aid and defend each other , this tribe would succeed better and conqu@@ er the other . &quot;
and as you &apos;ll see in this simulation , as they interact they gain points , as it were , they grow , and when they &apos;ve doubled in size , you &apos;ll see them split , and that &apos;s how they reproduce and the population grows .
it happened again about 120 or a 1@@ 40 million years ago when some sol@@ itary was@@ ps began creating little simple , primitive ne@@ sts , or hi@@ ves .
i don &apos;t mean that we evolved to join gi@@ gan@@ tic organized religions .
and that gives me hope because people are not pu@@ rely selfish .
so i realized then that i wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now .
here is another pretty typical scene . this is a subur@@ ban las ve@@ gas neighborhood .
and the thing you really hope for is occasionally they burn up , which we won &apos;t see tonight . so .
and this gra@@ ff@@ iti artist has come along , made this sign a little bit better , and then moved on .
and the more you try to think about it , the further the answer gets from you , and the minute you stop thinking about it , your intuition gives you that answer , in a sense .
that was it . that &apos;s all he saw as the options . and not too far off .
and it was pur@@ pos@@ ely done to look fairly serious .
this is how the ad ran throughout the world ; germany made one s@@ light change in the ad .
the co@@ ve@@ ted right-hand page was not given up to the whole issue .
what &apos;s next ? what &apos;s next is going to be people .
and if you would , you &apos;ve got a great job .
something , again , that went back to something more fundamental .
this is another version of that . this is a sea dra@@ gon , and the one on the bottom , the blue one , is a juven@@ ile that has not yet swal@@ lo@@ wed the acid , has not yet taken in the brow@@ n-@@ green algae pon@@ d sc@@ um into its body to give it energy .
they never touch the inner matter . there is more and more co-@@ evolution .
and he has decided to treat them as if they were tri@@ lo@@ bit@@ es , or sna@@ ils , and to do a mor@@ pho@@ logical analysis , and try to deri@@ ve their gene@@ alo@@ gical history over time .
so we &apos;ve all heard about the am@@ ish giving up cars .
and so a ham@@ mer , when we grab a ham@@ mer , that &apos;s what we &apos;re grab@@ bing .
and if you play that well , you &apos;ll have other people involved , so even that game exten@@ ds and continues even when you &apos;re gone .
and while a student at hawaii , i worked at the wa@@ i@@ ki@@ ki aqu@@ arium .
it &apos;s been a good ride .
so we created a way to find out , and i got my first look at that famous be@@ ak in action .
and over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4,000 meters of water creating enormous pressure , for@@ cing water down through the cr@@ acks toward the center of the earth , until it hits a mag@@ ma chamber where it becomes super@@ he@@ ated and super@@ satur@@ ated with min@@ erals , rever@@ ses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface and is e@@ je@@ cted out of the earth like a ge@@ y@@ ser at yel@@ low@@ stone .
and that e@@ ph@@ emer@@ al nature of the hydro@@ thermal v@@ ent community isn &apos;t really different from some of the areas that i &apos;ve seen in 35 years of traveling around , making films .
and a small group of thou@@ ght@@ ful people changed that bay .
now , sylvia &apos;s ted prize wish was to be@@ see@@ ch us to do anything we could , everything we could , to set aside not pin pri@@ cks , but significant exp@@ ans@@ es of the ocean for pre@@ ser@@ vation , &quot; hope spots , &quot; she calls them .
now the rules that i &apos;m talking about are constantly being monit@@ ored by the culture .
and then i thought -- in my 4@@ 0s i started thinking , &quot; well , why don &apos;t i do something ?
here &apos;s some numbers .
you could drop an atom bomb on a city , and 30 years later it &apos;s survi@@ ving .
so let &apos;s first talk about biology .
so is london a sc@@ aled up bir@@ ming@@ ham , which is a sc@@ aled up bri@@ gh@@ ton , etc . , etc . ?
and we &apos;ve looked at everything : more aids cases , flu , etc .
that would be bad for economies and cities .
but you notice , i &apos;ve che@@ ated , because i &apos;ve only gone up to &apos; 9@@ 4 .
right about the time that the internet gets going as an educational tool , i take off from wis@@ con@@ sin and move to kansas , small town kansas , where i had an opportunity to teach in a lovely , small@@ -@@ town , rural kansas school district , where i was teaching my favorite subject , american government .
but what was interesting about this position i found myself in in ar@@ iz@@ ona , was i had this really in a truly public school , and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities .
that is the absolute wrong thing to ask , to tell kids to never be wrong .
and when we do another round of this in my class this year , they will do better this time , because learning has to include an amount of failure , because failure is instruc@@ tional in the process .
it &apos;s simply accelerating the pace at which the body he@@ als itself to a clin@@ ically relevant ti@@ me@@ scale .
4@@ 1 people who were basically outside of being really sick , paying for the one reti@@ ree who was experiencing de@@ bil@@ itating disease .
if a new@@ t can do this kind of thing , why can &apos;t we ?
therefore , if we can find the right cells and im@@ plant them in the body , they may do the healing .
and that material induc@@ ed the body to switch back on a healing response that it didn &apos;t have before .
it &apos;s the coo@@ lest stuff .
it &apos;s a great source of stem cells .
it &apos;s very powerful work .
thank you .
oh , wonderful .
and -- oh , i saw gol@@ die ha@@ wn .
it &apos;s true . it &apos;s true .
but then on top of that , you know , sarah jones told me we only have 18 minutes .
so , we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else .
my name is pra@@ ve@@ en man@@ v@@ i and thank you very much for this opportunity .
my son , he says he is not ready to get married .
so i think maybe ted , you impact people &apos;s lives in the ways maybe even you don &apos;t realize .
that &apos;s all , shu@@ k@@ ran . thank you very much for the opportunity .
but i &apos;m actually here today to tell a story .
i started a couple of businesses that i thought would be the ticket to financial freedom .
but there &apos;s also a lot of people that you don &apos;t know .
and we don &apos;t just want people to see our movies and say , that was fun , and forget about it .
we &apos;ve sent 50,000 dv@@ ds to high school teachers in the u.s .
and finally , an e@@ bay li@@ sting for one well-@@ traveled slide show , now ob@@ so@@ lete , museum piece . please contact al gore .
believe it or not , some of us do survive .
it &apos;s been ta@@ ped with tape that we even stopped using in the u.k .
equipment that &apos;s ob@@ so@@ lete , equipment that doesn &apos;t quite work , or it works and you can &apos;t fix it . and there &apos;s nothing wrong with that , so long as we use it and we move on .
that &apos;s what he was doing , pro@@ pping up the bed because the bed simply didn &apos;t work .
these are the basic features of my device , or our device .
this was a huge impact on my mind , because i am a woman and i am a mother , and i hadn &apos;t realized that the hiv / aids pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way .
i &apos;ve traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years -- i went to about 12 different countries .
a@@ ve@@ li@@ le had the virus , she was born with the virus .
our enemies shall talk themselves to death , and we will fight them with their own con@@ fusion .
but over@@ throwing a government is one thing and building a stable democracy is a bit more complicated .
you have a situation where the relationship between government and local social networking companies is creating a situation where , effectively , the empower@@ ing potential of these platforms is being constra@@ ined because of these relationships between companies and government .
and here in the united kingdom there &apos;s also concern over a law called the digital economy act that &apos;s plac@@ ing more on@@ us on private inter@@ medi@@ aries to police citizen behavior .
but in the last two decades , it has experienced an unprecedented expansion , now accoun@@ ting for roughly 15 percent of the world &apos;s gdp .
the court system wasn &apos;t functioning properly .
the zones of production and distribution tend to lie in the developing world , and they are often threatened by app@@ all@@ ing violence and blood@@ shed .
so i have shown you this to demonstrate how many boats , how many vessels it takes to catch one of these guys .
now , i was taken by in@@ spe@@ ctor brian can@@ ter@@ a , of the royal canadian moun@@ ted police , to a ca@@ ver@@ n@@ ous war@@ e@@ house east of van@@ cou@@ ver to see some of the goods which are reg@@ ularly confi@@ s@@ cated by the r@@ c@@ mp from the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers who are sending it , of course , down south to the united states where there is an in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able market for b@@ .@@ c. bu@@ d , as it &apos;s called , in part because it &apos;s marke@@ ted as organic , which of course goes down very well in california .
hoo@@ ked it up to my laptop , and within about five minutes he had penetr@@ ated the computer security system of a major braz@@ i@@ lian bank .
there is no roman@@ ce involved with g@@ ang@@ sters in the 21st century .
everybody knew the answer .
you &apos;ve believed it through generations .
all his colleagues said , &quot; this is ou@@ trage@@ ous .
the only exception is the naked som@@ alian mole@@ -@@ rat , which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground .
try to imagine a gor@@ il@@ la performing the same man@@ eu@@ ver , and you can see that , compared with gor@@ il@@ la , we are halfway to being shaped like a fish .
sir david atten@@ bor@@ ough , he &apos;s come over .
acade@@ mia says no .
one -- i want to speak as early in the morning as possible .
ah , mark -- ser@@ fa@@ as .
i &apos;d basically di@@ sti@@ lled a very diffic@@ ul@@ t-@@ to-@@ explain and complex philosophy , which i won &apos;t get into here , because it &apos;s a little too deep for all of you , but -- it &apos;s about what makes websites popular , and , you know , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s unfortunate that i don &apos;t have more time .
and frog mode .
it &apos;s the process of creation that keeps me sort of a bubble and a half above perpe@@ tual anxiety in my life , and it &apos;s that feeling of being about 80 percent complete on a project -- where you know you still have something to do , but it &apos;s not finished , and you &apos;re not starting something -- that really fil@@ ls my entire life .
i think that the &quot; now tied up , tied down , mi@@ stress cru@@ el approaches me , now tied down , it &apos;s up . &quot;
you can send them an email .
you may not appreciate the person , you may not appreciate anything else , but maybe you appreciate the fact that they &apos;ve got a tough gi@@ g .
so when you do that , here &apos;s what i can promise : you &apos;re going to be the 800 pound gor@@ il@@ la in the forest .
and so i went home , and i made a prototype of this hat .
and i thought , &quot; well , hey !
this very basic shift in my physical ori@@ entation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the glac@@ ier .
yet we di@@ ther , taking no action to def@@ lect the asteroid , even though the longer we wait , the more difficult and expensive it becomes . &quot;
our problem and our tragedy is that in these hyper@@ -@@ parti@@ san times , the mere fact that one side says , &quot; look , there &apos;s an asteroid , &quot; means that the other side &apos;s going to say , &quot; huh ? what ?
it causes them to distor@@ t reality .
so , how warm or cold do you feel about , you know , native americans , or the military , the republi@@ can party , the democratic party , all sorts of groups in american life .
but the problem isn &apos;t primarily that we &apos;re elec@@ ting bad people to congress .
so here &apos;s another asteroid .
when americans go to college and marry each other , they have very low divor@@ ce rates .
and most surprisingly to me , they sometimes can even see eye to eye on criminal justice .
and this is the conver@@ sion of one group of sub@@ stances into another , either through the production or the absor@@ ption of energy .
so what we &apos;re trying to do is , we &apos;re trying to push these technologies towards creating bottom@@ -up construction approaches for architecture , which contrast the current , victori@@ an , top-@@ down methods which im@@ pose structure upon matter .
now , this is the very interesting part .
ven@@ ice is sin@@ king . to save it , rac@@ he@@ l ar@@ m@@ strong says we need to out@@ grow architecture made of in@@ ert materials and , well , make architecture that grows itself . she pro@@ poses a no@@ t-@@ qu@@ it@@ e-@@ alive material that does its own re@@ pairs and sequ@@ est@@ ers carbon , too .
i &apos;m scared . tell them to get away . &apos; &quot; as a young woman , i was in a psychiatric hospital on three different occa@@ sions for l@@ eng@@ thy periods .
this person is likely to have some form of schizophrenia .
this episo@@ de led to my first hospit@@ alization in america .
they wouldn &apos;t experience re@@ stra@@ ints as we would . &quot;
&apos;@@ okay . small . fire on ice . tell them not to kill me .
so let me share some final thoughts .
when i turned 18 , i lost my best friend to a car accident .
second it &apos;s driving itself .
they &apos;re the ve@@ ins of the ecosystem , and they &apos;re often empty ve@@ ins .
and i &apos;m sure you all know , this has created significant conflicts between the agricultural and environmental communities .
but they have no incentive to do so .
with streams and rivers dr@@ ying up because of over-@@ u@@ sage , rob har@@ mon has imple@@ mented an in@@ geni@@ ous market mechanism to bring back the water . farmers and beer companies find their f@@ ates inter@@ tw@@ ined in the intriguing cent@@ ur@@ y-@@ old tale of pri@@ ck@@ ly pe@@ ar cre@@ ek . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
but , yeah .
he &apos;s by far the happ@@ iest man ever measured by science .
and maybe because of that , compassion is organic and wide@@ spread comp@@ any@@ -@@ wide .
so what are they ?
so this mu@@ tual inspiration promot@@ es collaboration , initiative and creativity .
attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities .
cha@@ de-@@ men@@ g tan : everyday compassion at google
and it took a lot of courage for these defen@@ ders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in imple@@ menting these laws .
and with that , he successfully organized 6@@ 8 lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases .
and i was sitting side by side with one of our very coura@@ geous lawyers , and said , &quot; how can we get this out ? how can we make sure that this is imple@@ mented ?
so i thank you for having the pro@@ phe@@ tic imagination to imagine the sha@@ ping of a new world with us together , and invite you into this journey with us .
you know when they do home@@ works at home ?
it can be a school of design in jer@@ usalem that tries to find a better way to design gas mas@@ ks for people , because , as you know , israel dep@@ lo@@ ys one gas mask per person including babies .
hel@@ la j@@ ong@@ eri@@ us is a person that is able to make a synthesis that is really quite amazing and also quite hil@@ ari@@ ous .
so , designers sometimes don &apos;t do things that are immediately functional , but they &apos;re functional to our understanding of issues .
and that makes sense .
but i &apos;m going to try and do something different , and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories , and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we &apos;ve been talking about .
and what happened was , because they could afford it sometimes , sometimes not , i got kicked out pretty much every term .
my father , who i &apos;ve been talking about , died of aids in 1999 .
how would you look at me ?
so we need to start getting better .
and i can &apos;t empha@@ size that enough , you know .
you know , they &apos;re not going to change just out of nowhere .
a cou@@ sin of mine died of aids , left an or@@ pha@@ n , so we said , well , what are we going to do with her ?
and this is just an illu@@ stration .
long distance running was not only good for my well-being but it helped me med@@ itate and dream big .
but for every disaster we had , the marath@@ on found ways to bring people together .
i believe these are the building blocks for future peace .
he was out there in par@@ ol deli@@ vering a baby .
she is really the center of the health care system .
i &apos;m just going to sell these to every clinic in the world .
in may of 2010 , at 35 years old , with a two-@@ year-old at home and my second child on the way , i was diagnosed with a large ane@@ ur@@ y@@ sm at the base of my thor@@ ac@@ ic a@@ or@@ ta .
so these are my daughters .
most of the people who lived here either lived in coast@@ al villages , fishing , or were nom@@ ads who ro@@ amed around with the environment trying to find water .
this is probably the sky@@ line that most of you know about do@@ ha .
energy is the key factor here . it changed everything .
these risks directly affect the sustainability of this nation and its continu@@ ity .
imagine a country with abundant power -- oil and gas , sun@@ shine , wind -- but missing one key essential for life : water . infrastructure engineer fa@@ had al-@@ at@@ ti@@ ya talks about the unexpected ways that the small middle eastern nation of q@@ atar creates its water supply .
i &apos;ll try where it all started in the middle east , and for so many years we were living with completely the wrong perception of the middle east .
you see nine presi@@ dential candidates running against lu@@ ka@@ sh@@ en@@ ko .
so there are so many things you can do instead of getting into one place , shou@@ ting and showing off in front of the security forces .
it is true that the internet and new media are very useful in making things faster and cheaper .
2011 was a year of extraordinary peop@@ le-@@ powered resistance , starting with arab spring and spreading across the world . how did this resistance work so well ? s@@ r@@ d@@ ja po@@ po@@ vi@@ c lays out the plans , skills and tools each movement needs -- from non@@ violent tac@@ tics to a sense of humor . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and i said , &quot; do you remember when we were in college and really wild and kind of dumb ? &quot;
the majority of people .
i &apos;m a fifth generation tex@@ an .
and the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there .
this is like the failure conference .
us .
shame feels the same for men and women , but it &apos;s organized by gender .
you show me a man who can sit with a woman who &apos;s just had it , she can &apos;t do it all anymore , and his first response is not , &quot; i un@@ loaded the di@@ sh@@ wash@@ er , &quot; but he really list@@ ens -- because that &apos;s all we need -- i &apos;ll show you a guy who &apos;s done a lot of work .
it is a dream of mankind to fly like a bird .
we have to turn it , go up and go down .
and the ir@@ ony is that they don &apos;t need to be .
dr. v : see , mcdonald &apos;s &apos; concept is simple .
the effect of this has been that , within the first year , we really had a 40 percent pene@@ tra@@ tion in the market that it served , which is over 50,000 people .
the reven@@ ues increase at a higher level , giving us a healthy mar@@ gin while you &apos;re treating a large number of people for free .
now , how do you make people own the problem , want to do something about it ?
it is a mobile ph@@ one-@@ shaped box that has an iron weight inside , which we can move around , and you can feel where it &apos;s heavy .
as humans , we are social , we are em@@ path@@ ic , and that &apos;s great .
but even though i had this new@@ found joy and freedom , people &apos;s reaction completely changed towards me .
for me , this means that they &apos;re seeing the value of difference , the joy it brings when instead of focusing on loss or lim@@ itation , we see and discover the power and joy of seeing the world from exciting new perspe@@ ctives .
but even more striking than the fer@@ oci@@ ous power e@@ man@@ ating from that well was the re@@ ck@@ lessness with which that power was un@@ lea@@ shed -- the car@@ ele@@ ss@@ ness , the lack of planning that character@@ ized the operation from dri@@ lling to clean@@ -up .
a range of explan@@ ations may be po@@ pping into your mind by now , like &quot; gre@@ ed . &quot;
i &apos;m showing it because -- they &apos;re not a spon@@ sor , are they ? -- because , in its own way , this is a cra@@ ss version of our founding story .
ignore those cre@@ eping fears that we have finally hit the wall .
that &apos;s a person down there by the wheel .
a new fron@@ tier has been found .
bf : ... without a mac@@ arthur grant .
bf : that &apos;s all right , he does that . all right .
dh : wow , you &apos;ve been working out .
could you just push that ?
bf : ten years to perfect , which you &apos;re about to see .
the design of the body is a whole different thing .
dh : tell them about our bi@@ o and stuff .
and it &apos;s aw@@ fully win@@ dy over there .
because now , to make this twice as difficult , we &apos;ll ju@@ ggle the seven clubs back ...
i &apos;ll spend a fortune on it . i &apos;ve got a better idea .
if you &apos;ve ever seen an electron microscope picture , you &apos;ll see this . this all looks the same , then there &apos;s this bit over here which is incredibly complicated .
now , some people call her the first program@@ mer .
to give you an idea of how slowly , it had about 1@@ k of memory .

so unfortunately , this doesn &apos;t help this woman , but it does have severe , profound if you will , implications to her family .
but the gene that regul@@ ates that down is broken .
thank@@ fully , i was able to answer a , and i say that honestly in case my life insurance agent is listening .
and so imagine one more thing : that that software is able to ask both parties for mu@@ tual con@@ s@@ ents , &quot; would you be willing to meet your third cou@@ sin ? &quot;
hands it back to me . and we do that again and again .
so why should you care ? bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells .
these corals can be quite kind of mean , you see , and i have sur@@ fing sc@@ ars to prove that .
and things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly bal@@ anced .
finally , there &apos;s the force of gravity , which inter@@ acts with matter via its mass and spin .
so the electro@@ magnetic and weak forces are described by this pattern of particle charges in two-@@ dimensional space .
from this pattern , we already know the particle physics of these tiny scales . the way the universe works with these tiny scales is very beautiful .
each point in this pattern correspon@@ ds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape .
if the l@@ h@@ c finds new particles , but they don &apos;t fit this pattern -- well , that will be very interesting , but bad for this e@@ 8 theory .
but not worrying about rent allowed me to spend my time doing what i love .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ll be able to make this any clear@@ er .
so it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees are so like us , in certain aspects of their behavior .
so it &apos;s pretty sad to find that chimpanzees , like so many other creatures around the world , are losing their habit@@ ats .
they were interested in health ; they were interested in education .
the water -- water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we &apos;re going to face in this century -- and everywhere water is being pollu@@ ted by agricultural , industrial and household chemicals that still are being spra@@ yed around the world , seemingly with the in@@ ability to profit from past experience .
see the bri@@ ck wall as all these problems we &apos;ve inf@@ li@@ cted on the planet , environmental and social . it &apos;s a message of hope .
but -- oh , they &apos;re also working on hiv / aids .
all of these technologies we can use .
thank you .
i &apos;d go to the supermarket and all of my food is pack@@ aged in plastic .
we can cut the stem -- tide the stem of this into our oceans and in doing so , save our oceans , save our planet , save ourselves .
and yes , you also interact using natural ge@@ stures , both hands , etc .
my student pr@@ an@@ a@@ v , who &apos;s really , like i said , the genius behind this .
but when people learned what her son was ac@@ c@@ used of , she didn &apos;t get that sym@@ pathy .
it &apos;s up to us women , because we are women , because we love our children .
so , ai@@ cha , do you have a couple of words for conclusion ?
well , today , i &apos;d like to show you that through thinking differently , the problem has been solved .
so nothing is getting through .
that &apos;s not dirty enough . let &apos;s just sti@@ r that up a little bit .
then , after a few weeks , we set up camps .
so with just eight billion dollars , we can hit the millennium goal &apos;s target of hal@@ ving the number of people without access to safe drinking water .
and the second is about some new dimension which i want to refer to , which has never quite happened in the way it &apos;s happening now .
the world needs an international for@@ um .
up until now , the united states has been the dominant feature of our world .

the other 90 percent is dict@@ ated by our lifestyle .
we are programmed for something called pro@@ creative success .
but life expectancy in this country is only 7@@ 8 .
that &apos;s called the grandmother effect .
it &apos;s simply a little saying these people say before their meal to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is &#91; 80 &#93; percent full .

dan bu@@ et@@ t@@ ner : how to live to be 100 +
i &apos;m curious about how things work and how they are made , but also because i believe we should have a deeper understanding of the components that make up our world , and right now , we don &apos;t know enough about these high-tech compos@@ ites our future will be made of .
electronics k@@ its are very powerful in that they teach us how things work , but the constraints inher@@ ent in their design influence the way we learn .
i was a young driver out on the highway , and the car in front of me , i saw the bra@@ ke lights go on .
and i believe that . i believe that .
if i have a gps and a camera in my car , i have a pretty precise idea of where i am and how fast i &apos;m going .
but i believe it can be done in a way that prote@@ cts our privacy , just like right now , when i look at your car from the outside , i don &apos;t really know about you .
you can get eight , 10 minutes of weigh@@ t@@ lessness -- how nasa &apos;s trained their astron@@ au@@ ts for so long .
once he was there , &#91; we &#93; let him go to experience what weigh@@ t@@ lessness was truly like .
and what i &apos;ve tried to do since i had my training as a medical illustr@@ ator -- since i was taught animation by my father , who was a sculp@@ tor and my visual mentor -- i wanted to figure out a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences by using animation , by using pictures , by telling stories so that the things that are not necessarily evi@@ dent to people can be brought forth , and can be taught , and can be understood .
they pass information to each other .
so i packed my cat , my rot@@ twe@@ iler and my ca@@ mping gear into a 197@@ 5 ch@@ ev@@ y van , and drove off into the sun@@ set , having fully failed to realize three critical things .

there &apos;s a jewish saying that i love .
however , what matters most -- more than training or luck -- is the heart .
now , how can you have a deep tan and have no wr@@ ink@@ les ?
somehow she man@@ ages to keep her seven children alive , and a few months later , she gives birth to pre@@ mature tw@@ ins .
femin@@ ism has never been sexy , but let me as@@ sure you that it never stopped me from fli@@ r@@ ting , and i have sel@@ dom suffered from lack of men .
jen@@ ny is horri@@ fied at what she has done , but then the transl@@ ator explains that the patient &apos;s condition has nothing to do with the operation .
does it make sense to participate in the existing world order ?
why not ? it is possible . look around in this room -- all this knowledge , energy , talent and technology .
it &apos;s something that i &apos;ve worked on and a few other people , and it indi@@ cates a kind of hierarchy along with some assumptions about how many people stop at different steps and how the steps of thinking are affected a very different theory , a much more popular one , and an older one , due largely to john nas@@ h of &quot; a beautiful mind &quot; fa@@ me , is what &apos;s called equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um analysis .
so what you see here is a sub@@ traction of areas in which there &apos;s more brain activity when you &apos;re playing people compared to playing the computer .
it &apos;s good for them . they make a lot of money .
charles darwin and i and you broke off from the family tree from chimpanzees about five million years ago .
they &apos;re also very obsessed with status .

and even though there is food that we are producing at great cost , we don &apos;t actually value it .
the answer is what i call &quot; ancient food miles . &quot;
and , in fact , if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age , you can trace food coming in to it .
and this really is the moment when our relationship , both with food and cities , changes completely .
u@@ top@@ ia was actually a word that thomas moore used deliber@@ ately .

we need to realize that the world is also what we eat .
and the religions that should be making a major contribution are instead seen as part of the problem .
i want them to get the media involved because the media are crucial in helping to diss@@ olve some of the stereoty@@ pical views we have of other people , which are divi@@ ding us from one another .
k@@ aren ar@@ m@@ strong : let &apos;s revi@@ ve the golden rule
you de@@ code what you want to fold up into , into a sequence of angles -- so negative 120 , negative 120 , 0 , 0 , 120 , negative 120 -- something like that ; so a sequence of angles , or turns , and you send that sequence through the string .
if you have errors , you can replace a part .
sky@@ lar ti@@ b@@ bits : can we make things that make themselves ?
and obviously there &apos;s been tremendous practical applications associated with this world -- things like the eradi@@ cation of smallpox , the adv@@ ent of a vaccine against cer@@ vi@@ cal cancer , which we now know is mostly caused by human pa@@ p@@ ill@@ om@@ a@@ virus .
that as we explore these strings of a &apos;s , t &apos;s , c &apos;s and g &apos;s , we may un@@ cover a completely new class of life that , like be@@ i@@ jer@@ in@@ ck , will fundamentally change the way that we think about the nature of biology .
and especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by and to in@@ form your life decisions , then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other .
now how do we know about an environment that &apos;s so far away , and so different , and so alien , from anything we &apos;re used to ?
we happen to get round to testing , let &apos;s say , newton &apos;s law of gravity about 300 years ago .
all it takes is for a super@@ no@@ va to go off a few light years away , and we &apos;ll all be dead !
the world is bu@@ z@@ zing at the moment with plans to force reduc@@ tions in gas emissions at all costs .

let us have a hong kong nearby .

let &apos;s have a system where we have ownership of land that is regi@@ stered in a government office , that people can ple@@ dge as col@@ lat@@ eral .
we just take seawater and we filter it , and we collect different size organisms on different fil@@ ters , and then take their dna back to our lab in ro@@ ck@@ ville , where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every 24 hours .
i view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution .
this is a case where the software now builds its own hardware , and that &apos;s the no@@ tions that we have with biology .
after these genomes are synthe@@ sized , the first step is just trans@@ planting them into a cell without a genome .

and the idea is so simple , so obvious , but i think the consequences are really profound .
what about resources ? how are we going to feed nine billion people ?
in fact , just studying the rings alone , we stand to learn a lot about the disc@@ s of stars and gas that we call the spir@@ al galaxies .
it can wash the slu@@ dge off high mountain pe@@ aks and hills , down into the low@@ lands . so stop and think for a minute .
it was significant for another reason . this is an international mission , and this event was celebrated in europe , in germany , and the celebr@@ atory presen@@ tations were given in english ac@@ cents , and american ac@@ cents , and german ac@@ cents , and french and italian and dutch ac@@ cents .

so epi@@ le@@ p@@ sy patients sometimes need the electrical activity in their brain monitoring .
so if we take some out@@ bound path -- perhaps we park and we wan@@ der off -- we know because our own movements , which we can integrate over this path roughly what the heading direction is to go back .
so if this was happening , your memories could start by place cells activ@@ ating each other via these dense inter@@ connections and then re@@ activ@@ ating boundary cells to create the spa@@ tial structure of the scene around your vie@@ w@@ point .

how do you do that ?
leaders hold a position of power or authority , but those who lead inspire us .
the doctors , it seemed , never really had enough time for all the patients , try as they might .
so when i got this email from dr. ge@@ i@@ ger , i knew i was supposed to be proud to be part of this history .
and we chose to use the prescription for that purpose .
what if we had a waiting room where you don &apos;t just sit when you &apos;re sick , but where you go to get healthy .
and this isn &apos;t just a sort of short-@@ term workforce to connect patients to basic resources , it &apos;s a next generation healthcare leadership pipeline who &apos;ve spent two , three , four years in the clinic waiting room talking to patients about their most basic health needs .
i believe that we all have a vision for healthcare in this country .

really , we &apos;re doing this , basically . really , not very much .
and the reason is , it &apos;s been done .

maybe another kno@@ b is a kno@@ b for controlling co2 concent@@ rations .
i &apos;ll tell you how big the le@@ ver is : the le@@ ver is that big .
and that &apos;s one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about , and , in general , i think it &apos;s the underlying reason that it &apos;s been politically un@@ acceptable to talk about this .
we &apos;re going to go on a dive to the deep sea , and anyone that &apos;s had that lovely opportunity knows that for about two and half hours on the way down , it &apos;s a perfectly posi@@ tively pit@@ ch@@ -@@ black world .
let &apos;s take a look at it again . watch the color@@ ation : white on the right , brown on the left .
i thought it was all graphics -- so here it is in reverse .
&quot; we don &apos;t care about being happy . we need to live with passion .
i used to be a fan of b@@ ach . i used to play it on the guit@@ ar , you know .
but there &apos;s also w@@ ic@@ ked joy , you can re@@ jo@@ ice in someone &apos;s suffering .
at the opposite , everyone knows deep within that an act of sel@@ f@@ less gener@@ osity , if from the distance , without anyone knowing anything about it , we could save a child &apos;s life , make someone happy .
ben@@ evol@@ ence , loving kindness against hat@@ red .
so that &apos;s what those great med@@ it@@ ators have been doing .
so , i &apos;ve no time to go into all the different scientific results .
what is happiness , and how can we all get some ? bio@@ chemist turned buddhi@@ st mon@@ k mat@@ thi@@ e@@ u ri@@ card says we can train our minds in habits of well-being , to generate a true sense of seren@@ ity and ful@@ fil@@ l@@ ment .
the environments we are living in , more typically , are like these .
a public place so dis@@ mal that the win@@ os don &apos;t even want to go there .
ok .
and we &apos;re not going to cure the problems of the urban by dra@@ gging the country into the city , which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time .
so they take the first one that comes along , often .
we &apos;re going to have to re-@@ learn what the building blocks of these things are : the street , the block , how to com@@ pose public space that &apos;s both large and small , the cour@@ ty@@ ard , the civic square and how to really make use of this property .
please go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth caring about and a nation that will be worth def@@ ending .
the deeper you go , the more you run into a conflict with water .
here &apos;s a clip from a national geographic movie that came out in 1999 .
